Nuty cynamonowe obecne są od początku - niezbyt intensywne, zrównoważone, raczej pozostają w tle, ale konsekwentnie są obecne do końca. Smak słodki, takie cynamonowe ciasteczko w płynie, momentami z elementami takiego organicznego miodu. Pod koniec wchodzi ostra papryczka, nie wiem sam czy urozmaica czy zaburza całokształt. Na pewno nie jest irytująca. Na pewno jest też pewnym urozmaiceniem i przełamuje tą słodycz piwa. Pijalność na imponująco i niebezpiecznie wysokim poziomie. Piwo doskonale zrównoważone. Coż można rzec na koniec - podstawa słodowa genialna, przyprawy wnoszą fajne ciasteczkowate nuty, przełamane nieco ostrą papryczką, która dla niektórych może być niepotrzebna, a dla innych zbawienna.\n",

Quite full, oily, with soft carbonation and fairly subtle alcohol. Really nice stuff, not shy with the spices but achieves good balance and big concentration of flavours. Have to try this one again.\n",

You have to chew on this beer and appreciate the amazing balance of sweet, smokey,chocolate with nice subtle spice tones on the end. Spice , heat, sweet all come together into something that my words do not do justice. Better than the sum of its parts. A masterpiece worthy of praise. I would love to try something better- I’ve tried nothing close. Complexity incarnate.\n",

            "Geproefd op Borefts 2016, het eerste bier van het festival, en een waar ik lang naar uit heb gekeken. Het werd uitgeschonken in het festival proefglaasje uit een wijn decanteerder, slechts een half glaasje vol, wat natuurlijk het exclusieve imago verhoogd. Dikke olieachtige body, met weinig schuim, een kleine lichtbruine schuimkraag die snel wegtrekt. Aroma’s van chocolade, kaneel, koekjes, vanille, kokos, specerijen, sojasaus, donker fruit. Het smaakpallet is zeer complex en met een vol en olieachtig mondgevoel. Tonen van pure chocolade, zachte koffie, kokos, kaneel, vanille en een subtiele peper notitie, een geweldig complex bier. Zachte carbonatie, en een lange afdronk van kokos en lichte kruidige tonen. Prachtig bier om het geweldige Borefts festival 2016 mee te beginnen! Toch werden de torenhoge verwachtingen niet geheel ingelost, er waren 2 Imperial Stouts op dit festival die ik proefde die beter waren (deze waren wel BA overigens) Toch ben ik hard op zoek naar een fles van Cigar City Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout voor een meer uitgebreidere beoordeling in aroma en smaak notities. Cigar City is echt een zeer goede brouwerij uit de USA in meerdere stijlen.\n",

Taste and palate: full body, smooth, lots of spices in mouth too but it’s much more pleasant than in aroma, light bitter finish. Overall: good but not great. Don’t think it deserves to be rated that high. But I’m not a big spice fan. On the other hand the texture is prefect.\n",
            "Bottle, courtesy through SinH4 and Jdizzle1, many many thanks! Pours black with a dark brown foam. Aroma is pure cocoa and hot chocolate. Body is heavy, boozy, but with the hot chocolate there is coconut and coffee. Super sweet and also boozy, but it works so, so well. Palate drowns in flavours. Oh boy, what a great, great beer. Worth all the praise!\n",

Not too heavy in the mouth, extremely full and smooth, a good consistency for a sipper. Chilli heat is obvious, but is kept remarkably mellow. Taste dominated by sugars, unsurprisigly, but is rather complex. Plenty pf piparkakku, and a nice chocolatiness to the roast. Very nice brew. Almost beer of the evening apart from the batch 028 Pohjala Oo that we pretty much started with, that had aged and become serious, this is young and still trying to stuff itself with candies, cookies, and chocolate.

The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of cinnamon in front of a light cocoa and a lot of vanilla. The chilies don't really dominate, but offer a good peppery spiciness that is incredibly well balanced. The cinnamon comes back and is delightful. I love the smell on this. The flavor is great. Copious amounts of cinnamon up front and they ease through a nice pepper transition into a soft cocoa and vanilla, before reentering the cinnamon realm. The fact that the chilies are reserved makes this so much better. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. Great carbonation help it just cling to the mouth in a never ending film. The aftertaste is all cinnamon and subtly it moves through a good chocolate and vanilla lingering finish. Damn good. \n",

En bouche je fus saisi par la proéminence des épices qu’il m’avait été impossible d’anticiper en humant la bière. Le mélange d’épices et étonnant et également très complexe et homogène. J’ai décèle du chili doux, du poivre, de la cardamome et de la coriandre moulue. Il faut absolument reconnaître l’habilité avec laquelle le brasseur a su ficeler ces saveurs entre-elles.

Nose is cinnamon, chilies, vanilla, surprisingly not much roasted malt that I would expect from the colour. It reminds me of my wife’s chocolate chip cookies. Tastes sweet, cinnamon initially, then gives way to a little heat from the chillies and abv, vanilla is a large part of it too, the chocolate flavour is a large part of this beer as well, which I can only assume is from the nibs.

            "Bottle from last year’s Hunahpu’s Day, an event organized by Cigar City to deliberately hype this beer, to the example of Three Floyds’ Dark Lord Day (it cannot be a coincidence, by the way, that the label states that \"Hunahpu was tricked by the Dark Lords of the Underworld\" - this is doubtlessly an ironic nod to Three Floyds...). Makes me very curious to find out if it is worth the hype. Opaque black colour (revealing itself to be a very dark mahogany in the end) with high degree of viscosity, under a crackling, moussy, deep brownish beige head, almost reddish brown initially, steadily receding but retaining a thin rim around the edges. Very powerful and very seductive aroma, utterly complex, refinedly sweet, roasted and subtly spiced, first almost a ’dame blanche’ of chocolate sauce made with cognac poured over home-made vanilla ice cream, coffee liqueur, marzipan, sweet dried chili peppers clearly there, burning pipe tobacco, milk chocolate bars and Belgian chocolates, vivid accent of cloves and (strongly) cinnamon rolls, kahlua, cappuccino, eucalyptus, refined bourbon-like alcohol, cashew nuts, allspice, candied dates and cherries, subtle touch of meat broth... The ’basic’ and dense malts, hops and alcohol bouquet releases ethereal, volatile and beguiling sweet spice accents whenever it feels like it. What a fascinating smell... I can sniff it for hours. I cannot wait to take a sip, and must conclude that the taste follows the aroma perfectly: the expected dense candied sweetness opens the palate and makes my mouth water, candied fruits, with an almost refreshingly minerally sourishness coming from carbonation, which may perhaps be a little bit stronger than usual for the style, but fits in perfectly here. A soft and beautiful vanilla sweetness is apparent already early on, even strongly so, but I love vanilla so this is, to say the least, a welcome surprise. Very creamy, velvety, viscous, oily mouthfeel and obviously very thick body, revealing an abyss of malts, very chocolatey, nutty and caramelly, with a strong mocha bitterness after the middle, lively and not just from roasted malts, but an actual, powdery and refined coffee beans flavour. Cinnamon comes up retronasally along with that wonderful vanilla flavour, and then the finish evolves, with a big and thick lingering malt and candy sweetness, cloying even, aided by peppery hop bitterishness and of course warming, but nonetheless very gentle, liqueur- or rhum-like alcohol; the cinnamon and coffee stick to the throat, as a mixture of sweet, bitter and umami flavours, but given the immense complexity of this beer, it is hard to tell which ingrediënt causes which aftertaste... The ancho and pasilla chili peppers, both rather mild varieties, are there, but provide just a subtle burning touch in the back of the mouth and throat, without disturbing the overall balance; I do get their earthy, smoky, sweetish, peppery flavour though, only adding further complexity. This brew is indeed hugely complex and consists of layer upon layer of flavour, absolutely divine. It takes a lot of concentration - and a large bottle - to try and grasp what is going on in this one, and this is again a reminder of what beer as a beverage is capable of. This kind of top quality beers of utmost complexity move me. Yes, this is clearly worth the hype; this is an awe-inspiring imperial stout, managing to respect all the qualities of its style and building upon them an own personality; I’m pretty sure I will recall this taste for the rest of my life. If it weren’t for the somewhat sticky, cloying effect in the back of the mouth and throat, I’d give it a perfect score, which would have made it my very best beer so far. For now: just one inch away from being perfect.  But then, considering my previous experiences with this brewery, I did have high hopes for this, admittedly.\n",

Aromas of malts come out, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, and hints of bread and peppers. Taste was heavy cloying sweetness, and a bit of the peppers hit the tongue to give you just enough kick. I’m thinking had I gotten this fresh that would have been more dominant and less sweet. Full body, oily feel, average carbonation, and a nice sweet/light spice finish. This was definitely good and what I have been expecting all the time I was seeking it. I recommend this one.\n",

La mousse foncée monte docilement mais ne reste pas bien longtemps. Le nez est complexe, riche, cohésif. Ça sent les épices, la réglisse, le biscotti aux amandes, les fruits enrobés de chocolat, la mélasse poivrée, la noix de coco vanillé, le café caramélisé, le tabac à pipe et j’en passe. La liste pourrait encore être bien longue. Des arômes de qualité supérieure puis-je me permettre d’affirmer. Ma bouche est certainement ravie. Les sucres résiduels sont importants mais habilement secoués par une petite chaleur d’alcool, par un piment bien dosé et par une attaque céréalière justement rôtie. Autant d’éléments intelligemment placés pour éviter une trop grande férocité sucrée. Au palais, le liquide est fortement musclé. La texture est presque sirupeuse et même parfois un peu trop lourde. En deuxième moitié de la dégustation, les commissures de mes lèvres restent légèrement collées. Les bulles fines et explosives me semblent être façonnées, enfin, je le pense, pour tenter d’éviter toute forme de suffocation. En finale, les notes pimentées chaudes et l’amertume noire viennent gratter le fond de ma gorge avec une certaine intensité. Une bouteille datée du 8 mars 2014. Très bonne bière qui ne semble pas être capable de totalement m’étonner.\n",

Has a hot peak, at first introduced by a decent hop bitterness, carried by a generous malt earthiness, transforming into a spicy, hot chili burn. This spiciness numbes the palate for a short glance, then revealing an interplay between a slick coffee bitterness and mellow, sweet chocolate. Finishes with a semi-dry aspect and cinnamon to it, including the taste of whole, burned coffee beans, dipped into hot chocolate. Burning, hot Jalapeno and cinnamon are sticking on the outside of my teeth, accompanied by a subtle sweetness. The balance of this brew is outstanding, regarding its complexity. There are no moments in which any off-flavors get revealed, or in which the beer turns into something odd, but its full body is defined by a great smoothness and diversified taste.\n",

            "I try not to get caught up in the hype of beers like Cigar City Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout that are only released once a year on a special day at the brewery for which you need to buy tickets in advance (i.e. Dark Lord, Kate the Great, etc.). But since two friends of mine in Florida were generous enough to send me a bottle of the last two editions, I figured it was okay to get a little excited. And now that I’ve tried the beer I can definitely see why it receives the praise it does. This is a very unique and impression imperial stout brew as it utilizes a variety of spices and flavorings to give it a taste you’re not going to find in any other beer of the style. It’s not quite world class, but it is damn good.\n",

            "Taste: My friends and I started out with the 2014 edition, which at the time of drinking was an 11-month-old bottle. Right away there was a huge sensation of dark baking chocolate – intensely bitter, but also rich with chocolaty sweetness. Dark cherry and other fruit flavors are prominent as well, probably likely derived from the use of massive amount of malt in the brew (a lot of imperial stouts tend to have similar characteristics). On the second half, a strong surge of cinnamon spice sweeps across the palate – creating for a Christmas cookie-like taste. As it goes down, there’s a warmth from the peppers, though I would not consider it spicy in a peppery way. All in all it’s quite delicious, though a bit repetitive. I’d probably prefer a touch more sweetness, but what’s here is extremely pleasant.\n",

            "The 2013 edition was noticeably different. The pepper character had faded, though the chocolate component had not only strengthened, but gone from bitter dark chocolate to sweet milk chocolate. The alcohol was also a bit more pronounced, ironically enough, though it did create for a slightly smokey, bourbon-like flavor. Cinnamon was still quite potent on the finish, though it was more a sweetness than a spice. It left a residual cloying/sticky sensation which is common for many imperial stouts. I don’t think anything was gained by aging this vintage, in fact, it was probably hindered a bit since the spicy character was weakened (though if you don’t like spice, cellaring a bottle is the way to go).\n",

The mouthfeels were, of course, full-bodied, but with a soft texture and smoothness as it went down. Not much in the way of alcohol warmth, though the fresher vintage definitely had some noticeable heat from the peppers (but again, nothing too extreme). The 2013 vintage traded Scoville heat for alcohol heat and it was actually rather cloying in the aftertaste whereas the 2014 was remarkably dry. I’m glad I split these bottles with friends, though I was certainly feeling the weight of the brew bearing down on me afterwards. Splitting a bottle with friends and family is definitely the way to go.\n",

While I am arguably late to the party Founders' products have increasingly become my go-to brewery over the last couple of years due to the nigh on unbeatable combination of relatively low cost and - crucially - consistently very high quality of their products. I am yet to be disappointed and would argue that Founders is among the beer-aficionado's best friends in these trying times for our world.\n",

            "Having said that, the deep dark brown slightly oily, murky body of this brew is perhaps not the most inviting. The espresso-coloured head does help improve the looks along with the crocheted lacing. \n",
            "\n",
            "Given the alcohol level the first impressions of the aroma are perhaps lighter, less pungent and invasive than one would hope for and expect. Not that it is anything wrong with that, not at all. Regardless, the main impressions are of smoky, slightly bittersweet roasted malts with notes of wet charcoal, freshly baked brown bread and spices. The sweet component might be something akin to vanilla or similar.\n",

            "The flavour is at first distinctly sweeter when compared to the aroma. Again, this is not a problem, the KBS gives you an initial bitter smack on the snout before soothing you with its sweet touch. This reviewer always enjoy beers where the combination of aroma and flavour are distinctly different but come together to produce a great experience. The dark malts are still there, but the bitterness is less prominent in the notes of cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee. The characteristics of bread and vanilla from the aroma are joined by bourbon barrels leading into a long, dry and bitter finish. One could argue that the finish is too bitter and dry for some, and I might agree at least on some level. Regardless, this combination of aroma and flavours will take you on a rollercoaster-like brewbased thrillride.\n",

Aroma is chocolate croissant with roasted grain and nuts.  Mouthfeel isn’t as think as the pour would suggest, but certainly had a texture.   The first few sips blew me away.  What shot right though the middle was a vegetal, almost green bell pepper streak that I wasn’t expecting at all.  It was enveloped by what you might expect.  Subtly sweetened croissant, toasted grains and yes a touch of a bourbonish aftertaste (not the aftertaste of the beer, the aftertaste of a sip of bourbon).   Again, the vegetal taste really stands out to me in a spectacular way.  This is more savory than sweet and I wasn’t expecting it.  The aftertaste of the beer is not bitter, more toasted, and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome.  There’s absolutely some warmth in the back of the throat.  The complexity is astonishing.  I cannot believe it has taken me this long to have this. An all time great.\n",

Ugyanakkor a KBS meg csak KBS, gondoltam magamban, biztosan tud azért valamit, ami egy olyan közepesen tapasztalt fogyasztónak is nyújt valami izgalmasat, amilyen én vagyok. Nos, újfent tévednem kellett. A relatíve magas elvárásaimat félretéve is ez bizony ez tisztességesen összerakott, korrekt kis impy közepes, vagy annál kissé kevéssé intenzív hordós karakterrel.

Like studying a dark Rembrandt painting, I drift between the layers, the brushstrokes, the characters within the scene. No particular aroma overpowers the tableau. It goes without saying that dark chocolate and coffee are a strong presence, but too often those smells are broad and generic — KBS goes another step further. The coffee itself is fruity and nuanced, with hints of cherry and brown butter and toffee. There is a hint of vanilla bean, light licorice, some orange peel and mango. Rye bread and blackberry jam. The flavors are equally well balanced. The mouthfeel starts with an inviting, roasted bitterness of dark chocolate, progressing into a sweeter, custardy, vanill-y, crème brûlée, and finishing again with a punch of espresso. Fine carbonation throughout. Again, KBS shows restraint — while bourbon notes are present, they don't overpower. Too many imperial stouts want to boast their barrel-aged bonafides, but end up being as barbaric as a boilermaker. A rousing success.\n",

Mais déception car les arômes de café et de chocolat sont trop effacés par rapport à ceux de caramel et de bourbon omni présents. L'équilibre n'est également pas parfait, un sucre trop présent alourdit ma bouche et les arômes de bourbon un brin trop violents. Ce KBS vit encore je pense sur son image d'antan, un temps où les imperial stouts maturés en fût étaient rares. Actuellement, il existe bien mieux. Côté visuel, nous sommes sir un noir total quasiment sans mousse, classique. Le nez est intense avec un bon caractère sur le chocolat, le café, le caramel, le bourbon, le fût de chêne et la vanille. Nous n'obtenons pas la même plénitude à la dégustation avec l'alcool à 12,3% trop sur les devants, un sucre trop présent et les arômes de caramel et de fut de bourbon écrasant les autres. Excellente ampleur aromatique en seconde bouche sur un alcool chaleureux mais trop présent. Les arômes sont linéaires et se retrouvent d'ailleurs tels quels en arrière-bouche et sur le final. Excellentes longueurs et corpulences par contre et une amertume à 70 d'IBU bien dosé. Ce stout manque d'un peu de finesse.\n",

Aroma, chocolate, vanilla, impression of lactose too however, lotsof bourbon, somewhat vinous, gently burnt underneath.  Very good but lacks true depth.  Taste a bit more impressive even though the barrel aging seems less obvious: rich, creamy, good roast, dense, chewable, well balanced, albeit a bit too sweet for my taste, soft, alcohol well hidden.  MF very dense and softly astringent. Very good, very tasty, lacks a bit of finesse because it's too sweet and crude, a highly acclaimed brew that consequently makes me appreciate some of my own little Belgium's brews  even more.  Sugar... makes my arteries clogged up with cholesterol, eats my teeth and messes up my beers.  I can live with heart attacks and cavities but...

Bourbon, coffee, molasses, vanilla and chocolate - but not too sweet - and a well-roasted malty bitterness to close. Aftertaste is bourbon-inflected bitter malt. Not overly boozy, but packs a wallop. Dry finish; a bit cloying. An outstanding beer. I think the sweetness to bitterness balance is amazing.\n",

            "A 12 fl. oz. bottle, bottled on 13th March 2018. Poured into a snifter glass. It was dark brown to black in colour with a half finger mocha brown head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left some nice lacing. Aromas were roasty, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak and a light caramel. Tastes of roasted malts, lots of rich dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, light bitter finish. Creamy, smooth, full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall aroma wasn’t as rich as the taste, but the taste was outstanding with the strong rich and smooth chocolate flavours. The coffee, bourbon and oak balanced it out very nicely, and it was just a great sipper for a cool winter (or air conditioned) night.\n",

Heavy sweet aftertaste. Low carbonation. Overall: Ive had a few from this brewer and never been disappointed. I think I was expecting the perfect stout from what I knew about this beer. It was very good, but the booze taste is too dominant. I realize the ABV is over 12%, but I've had better beers that mask this. The mouthfeel is too heavy and almost like syrup.

Strong nose of whiskey, roasted barley, molasses, vanilla, chocolate and brown sugar. Tastes sweet of brown sugar, boozy, caramel, big vanilla, whiskey, chocolate. Thick bodied, need a pizza cutter, viscous, sticky on the lips, this is going to kill me, but I survived 2014 at Copenhagen airport. Practice made me stronger. Perfect brew!\n",

            "Még 2016-ban volt szerencsém beszerezni egy palackkal a sörös pályafutásom legnagyobb mérföldkövének számító főzetből, abból is egy 2015-ös példányból, melyet valóságos legendák öveznek, a legújabb kori kézműves őrületet megelőzően az egyik legnagyobb kuriózumnak számított, egy európai fogyasztó számára pedig egyenesen elérhetetlennek tűnt a Three Floyds klasszikusa. Éppen ezért álltam ellen mindenféle kísértésnek az elfogyasztását illetően, s vártam ki a megfelelő alkalmat, amelynek meghatározása nem nélkülözött némi fejtörést sem, az idő múlásával ugyanis egyenes arányban nőtt a palack eszmei értéke, ezáltal pedig a szóba jöhető események köréhez is mindinkább valamiféle grandiózus jelleget próbáltam párosítani. Úgy esett, hogy ezt az alkalmat jobbnak láttam a sörtesztelések világához, nem pedig valamiféle egyéb jelentőséggel bíró eseményhez kötni, s mintegy megkoronázva a pontozásaim történetének egy jelentős szakaszát, a Dark Lord felszabadítására az ezredik értékelésem apropójából került sor. Ekképpen ültem meg tehát a személyes milleniumomat, amely nem kizárólag az ünnepelt darab beltartalma okán, de a főzet hírneve, az őt övező pátosz, az exkluzivitás jellege, s a Dark Lord szinte mitikus névjegye alapján is méltó zárása volt egy ezertagú sörsornak. A sörkészítés jelenkorának szuperszonikus világában néhol az \"imperial\" jelző is kevésnek bizonyul - amely ital legalább háromféle hordóban nem nemesedett korábban, szinte nem is vehető számításba. Mondom ezt némileg keserű éllel annak ellenére, hogy jómagam is megszállottja vagyok a hivatkozott típusoknak. Háttér-információként azonban elengedhetetlen említést tenni arról, hogy a Dark Lord születése táján talán kevesebb nagyvad futkosott a sörmezőkön, s egy efféle kaliberű ital abban az időben valamiféle \"non plus ultra\"-ként funkcionálhatott. S hogy rátérjek magára a főzetre, kiemelést érdemel, hogy ez a sör manapság sem marad alul az érlelés nélküli palackok egyikével szemben sem; ha csupasz valójukban szemléljük a tényeket, a Dark Lord akkor is az egyik legsúlyosabb szereplő a piacon. A már unalomig ismert közhelyek pufogtatása, mint az olajos, szirupos karakter jelenlétének leírása ez esetben kevésnek bizonyul a helyzet érzékeltetéséhez, ehhez fogható mértékegység még nem született a súly meghatározására. Ízjegyei maradéktalanul hűek illatához; aszalt szilvás, datolyás, mézes-mazsolás, barnacukros, karamellás, s természetesen kávés, csokoládés elemek robbanása eredményez hasonló összképet. Valóban édesek, szó szerint sziruposak a kortyai, a lenyomata egyenesen feltapad a pohár falára, az ízgazdagság, a szerkezet rétegzettsége azonban magasabb szintre emeli az italt egy egyszerű, édesszájúaknak készített imperial stout-tól. Mélysége, kidolgozottsága, mesteri rétegzettsége, s elementáris ereje valóban feledhetetlen, könyörületet nem ismerő főzetté teszi, amely távol áll a mindennapok szürkeségétől, egyhangúságától, kétségtelenül a jeles események éke, kitüntetett figyelmet érdemlő alkotás.\n",

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, nutty coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, cake batter, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, and toasted dark bread; with light notes of smoke, char, leather, tobacco, sherry, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast notes; with big strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, nutty coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, cake batter, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, and toasted dark bread; with light notes of smoke, char, leather, tobacco, sherry, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very mild hop, roast, char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, nutty coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, cake batter, licorice, dark fruit, toasted dark bread, light smoke/char, leather, tobacco, sherry, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast flavors; with a solid hop/roast bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and extremely full body; with a very creamy, silky, velvety, and rich mouthfeel the is perfect; lightly slick/syrupy. Minimal sticky hops, chalky roast, or dryness. Minimal warmth of 15%, with zero booze lingering after the finish. Overall this is an insane flavored Russian imperial stout! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV, with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Insanely rich and complex; with perfect balance of malts, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast. This is the smoothest 15% stout I've ever had. Completely lived up to the original hype it had in the early years. A world class RIS.\n",

Why not make it a Dark Lord? To be honest, my novice beer mind never even looked into whether Dark Lord is barrel aged as a regular beer. Novice here. Doesn't matter though, the beer is good. A seriously huge thanks to prufrockstar for the bottle. One of the finest folks I've had the pleasure of meeting on this site. Cheers to you, my friend! Green sparkling wax, so a 2017 I'd have to assume. No indication for me during the blind that this was a non barrel aged entry. I picked up plenty of bourbon notes. I suppose you don't need a barrel to have bourbon notes come through. Either that or you just need to be enjoying great beers in a blind tasting, expecting it. Dense, near black pour. Rich chocolate forward nose. Sweet for sure, but it's not enough to turn me off of it. Has a vanilla like creaminess to it. Reminded me of a dessert stout, so revealing this bottle was quite a surprise. Toasty malt, cinnamon, coffee. Quite bitter in the end as well. The first time I tried Dark Lord was with Tcon down at a little pizza restaurant in Seattle several years ago. The owner had pulled one out of the cellar to enjoy with some friends and wouldn't stop talking about it. After a couple questions from a couple of beer lovers that had only wished to have tried it, she mentioned that she had about a quarter bottle left, but that it had been sitting for hours and hours. Didn't care. Was good under those conditions. Even better in a fine setting like this tasting. A really enjoyable beer for sure. Hope this isn't my last experience with it. Thanks again, Chris!\n",

Aroma is really big overall and has an intense core of burnt sugar, quite heavy on black olive/soy sauce/mushroom/umami quality, dark fruit, ripe figs, roasty malts with a little chocolate. Flavour is again hyper-concentrated and fairly sweet, but not to the extent I expected after trying BA versions. It explodes with notes of black olive, soy sauce, figs, stewed plums, moderate roast to the dark malty core, toasted, definitely some feeling of sugar but not without balance, even a little tang from the olives/fruit. Roast and a bit of alcohol gives a healthy amount of drying to the back end, but the umami quality persists throughout the sip and into the aftertaste. Thick viscous body with very soft carbonation. Not really what I was expecting, as it's huge but not terribly sweet in small portions (would not split a bottle in two!), and the massive umami makes it really different.\n",

            "July 2016 – Rating #6000. Bottle share at Craft Beer Co Islington as ’Three Floyds Dark Lord’. Orange wax 2013 version. Many thanks indeed to Leighton for the Ratebeer bucketlister. Black, opaque with a foamy brown head. Aroma is molasses, some chocolate, demerara, coffee. Body is smooth, soft carbonation, oily. Taste is chocolate, coffee, plum, molasses, spicy with a touch of booze showing up but minimal considering the hefty ABV. A good beer without a doubt. Meaty sweet up front but improves the more you drink it – or gets you drunk enough to overlook the sweetness. Either way, I like it. Probably consumed at the perfect age, I’d say. Old enough to gain some complexity and lose some sweetness, but young enough not to have any noticeable oxidation. Good. (3.9)\n",

Sweet, mouthcoating, with a light alcohol bitter stench developing being kept though in check by the sweetness. Lasting finish with a slight herbal spice burn. Potent.\n",

Super sweet but in a good way (for me). Had back-to-back with a Midnight Sun Bezerker.

Sweet and with lots of umami notes. The cacao is there but it feels more wine-like...almost like single origin cacao with that berry nuance.

The nose was mocha notes, caramel & treacle sweetness, a touch of vanilla, dark fruit, some vinous nature, and ready alcohol. The taste was similar notes, medium+ bodied, sticky & syrupy textured, with low carbonation, a touch of tartness, obvious booze, and a presence that was too sweet, and a bit thinner than I remember to be totally enjoyable for me.

            "I finally took up the courage to dig out this bottle from my cellar: the famous Dark Lord. Must have been one of the first (deliberately) hyped craft beers, but being European, not having obtained it from Dark Lord Day which is apparently the only day per year on which it is sold, and not being too susceptible to hypes, I will try to rate this without prejudice. Rating concerns the blue-waxed 2014 edition. Pours ink black and visibly viscous yet burgundy on the edges, leaving deep yellow, oily stains on the walls of the glass, with a dark reddish beige, very loose head forming only with some forcing, sparkling and crackling but almost instantly dissolving, much like the head on Coca-Cola; all that is left in a matter of instants, are some small, loose, unstructured bubbles on the edges, cautiously escaping from the unfathomable darkness beneath. The very last remnants of the bottle consist of patches of muddy proteins and, likely, unfermented molasses...  As for the aroma, the ’smoke’ hung around in the neck of the bottle upon opening and by inhaling it, I already caught a glimpse of the sheer intensity of this beer. Putting my nose in the sherry glass in which I poured it, makes me fall passionately in love with this beer immediately - all the burdens of every day life are forgotten, this is utter beer heaven: a deep, rich, extremely complex and seductive tapestry of the purest quality chocolate, both dark and milk, vanilla beans, Flemish red cabbage (a wee bit iron-like) cooked with brown sugar, candied cherries, molasses and dark rhum, fine coffee but rather subtle and peeping through the chocolate from time to time, treacle, slowly stewed beef and even whiffs of cured meat every now and then, toffee and ’Haagse hopjes’, leather, suggestions of marmelade, pipe tobacco, mocha ice cream, black peppercorns, chocolate liqueur, sweet hazelnut oil, cloves, cognac, pear syrup and a clear hint of teriyaki sauce - this is totally addictive, I cannot get enough of it. I cannot wait to take a small sip of this, and the taste is even more impressive than the aroma: a strong, enormously intense yet fine-tuned and noble candied sweetness opens this adventure in flavour, with all kinds of candied cherries, dates, peach, even oranges dancing among each other, kept in place by a very refined, tingling carbonation, almost of the same level as a coke which has been exposed to the air for a while, but providing a little bit of sourness to balance the big candied sweetness. After this friendly overture, I am plunged head first in an abyss of malts, layer upon layer of toffee, caramel, chocolate, even hints of toast, enriched with the deep, thick molasses sweetness and a strong presence of vanilla, which reveals itself retronasally in even more glory. The mouthfeel gets a bit of relief from the refined, gentle carbonation, but needless to say, is otherwise big and fat, syrupy, yet smooth and supple. The - aptly named - Dark Matter coffee remains something of a background presence: there certainly is a coffeeish flavour in the end, with a very pleasurable retronasal effect along with the vanilla, but it stays fairly modest in comparison with the gigantic ’chocolateness’ which dominates the palate; roasted bitterness stays gentle as well. Maltiness squared best describes the finish: the lingering chocolate sweetness carries everything, and even manages to bring balance to the unavoidable glow of throat-warming, rhum- and liqueur-like alcohol which goes down deep into the chest. The balance does not quite succeed, and in this particular case, for once, this is a good thing: in a beer this sweet and sugary, the peppery, drying alcohol effect in the end prevents too much cloyingness, though the thick texture does coat the mouth and tongue for a long time after swallowing. A dim, earthy hop bitterishness resides in the deepest caverns of this demonic stout, while the vanilla and elegant coffee flavours haunt the nose cavity after swallowing. A meaty umami flavour accompanies this whole ’parcours’ but it too remains subtle - it seems all the other flavours are afraid of this vast ocean of dark chocolate. Sorry to go all lyrical about this beer: I sometimes have that in really big imperial stouts. This one, to my taste, is worth the hype and worth every penny; I have been waiting to open this one and now that I did, I regret not possessing a second one for a dark and gloomy winter night, when this beer type - to my personal experience at least - truly comes into its own. Go out, wait for hours in line if necessary, but if you are into imperial stouts, you must do everything in your power to get a sip of this, this is simply divine. It has an almost unmeasurable complexity I have rarely seen, every time I sniff from it, I get different odours, one more endearing than the other, and it has an intensity of flavour rarely matched. Agreed, it has an intense chocolate and candied sweetness which sticks to the mouth cavity for a while, but the alcohol and the coffee provide enough balance for that.  I am very happy that I finally, after having read about this beer for years, had the chance to taste a bottle of this - heck, I could care less about the fact that the 15% ABV in a bomber of 65 cl will likely make me too drunk to taste other beers properly afterwards...  Still, even this iconic beer is not beyond criticism, and a more recent (2015) sample I had this year, was a little over the top in its umami-like ’beefiness’ - though still a beautiful beer - so my rating here is an average of both.\n",

Aroma was very fruity with cherry, apple, and syrup. Flavor has a lot of sweetness, and yes, sad to say that apple juice flavor dominates the whole thing. However, there were some touches of cream and toasted dark fruit. Mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth. While I definitely want to try a better vintage, having the \"worst\" Dark Lord is akin to listening to the \"worst\" Beatles album.

Most of this got crushed as me and some other drunks stumbled towards the hotel from the Grand Tasting venue across from Founders. Drinking on the street was never better. I should have wrapped it up in a brown paper bag. Beer was blackish but maybe that had to do with the lack of real good street lights. You know it was fucking tasty as all get out but I became more focused on not being found in a dumpster in the morning. Staying awake for the next 30 hours didn’t turn out to be the best idea I’ve had but those automatic flushing toilets in the Chicago airport made it all worthwhile.\n",

A really good beer - not getting too much soy sauce like a lot of people said, and the alcohol was well hidden.\n",
            "\"09 release...obviously pours jet black, with a better than expected (but quickly disappating) dark brown head. the aroma is a little on the sweet side, but way complex. chocolate soaked cherries, wood, molasses, brown sugar. some alcohol present too. body is thick and smooth, but not cloying. feel is awesome...coating and warming at the same time, without being hot. like a toned down World Wide. flavor is awesome. lots of the same qualities of the aroma, but they work better in the flavor. a little charred flavor as well. very wine/port like. overall, an awesome beer. worth the price and hype? yes and no...probably more no. Not when World Wide is similar (though not the same) at about $8 a bottle, and other great RISs are out there for way way less. Glad we tried it the once. MAYBE i’ll revisit an aged bottle in the future. 11/11 - 2009-2010-2011 vertical: 2010 was amazing, while the aroma was just a touch behind on the newer 2011 (though the cofee presence was more obvious and very nice), and the 2009, while still great, is just starting to fade a little and become excessively sweet...but only when in comparison to the nearly perfect 2010 batch.\"\n",

Complex and smooth flavor, amazingly well balanced and deceptive in alcohol content for it’s ABV. Upfront a sweetness/soy character, with molasses and sweet malt coming through later on and a very mild, sweet, roasty finish. Not much coffee evident, interestingly. Thick bodied and average carbonation. A great imperial stout. although may be slightly too hyped for it’s own good -- would be interested to see how this one holds up with age.

The aroma hits you with a potent bourbon and heavy chocolate. These elements are rounded out with vanilla, coffee, some light toffee, roasted malts, and slight mint. The main impression from the taste is that its extremely sweet, probably to sweet. Its big on bourbon and vanilla, with caramel and chocolate found and becoming more pronounced at the end. Aftertaste of bourbon, more chocolate, and less vanilla sticks with you for a long time. Full in body and milder in carbonation. The texture is very oily, like syrup actually. Without a doubt this is excellent. Its unique, strong, and intense. Its great for the experience of actually getting the chance to try this.

Slightly hazy pale ale with a medium-sized white head. Aroma of malt, citrus and pine. Medium body and carbonation. Taste of sweet malt, grapefruit,  orangepeel and hops. Light bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. A lovely, well balanced and tasty imperial IPA. Been waiting to try this for a while and it was worth the wait.  A reference for the style.\n",

Taste has sweetish apple, melon & mango; all in all restrained and making way for a bitter core of pine, citrus peel & herbs kept together by a dry-biscuity malt body, with a faint hint of sourish citrus. Bitter, dry, resinous & slightly peppery hoppy finish that is quite dank & cheesy, but also herbal and grapefruity. Faint hint of warming gin-like alcohol in the very end. Full body, oily texture, average carbonation. Evidently the expectations are enormous for a beer of this renown, and they've been well met. An overwhelming sensation, though, is held back by its almost 'disciplined' structure.\n",

Would never peg this for an Imperial IPA...so clean, fresh & dry. The piney flavor explodes like a firework, then dissipates quickly. It definitely lives up to its hype, and is one of the top two or three beers I've had the opportunity to rate over the years.\n",

            "500 ml bottle from City Beer Store, San Francisco. Three weeks old! Pours an impressive gold, but the head only came when I hard poured. Aroma not as impressive as I expected - just the usual lemon, orange and passionfruit. Taste of honey malt, slight esters and a ton of resinous dank hops. To me that stuck out like a sore thumb and I didn't quite like it. Heavy carbonation but pretty OK mouthfeel. Wouldn't rate it as highly as the other hopheads here.\n",

There were few carbonation tails. It left wonderfully fine and evenly distributed glass lace. Crisp aroma of floral and perfumy hops, with hints of tropical fruit. Definitely ale esters. High ABV nose makes malt hard to pull through. First taste is rich and full with ample dry malt to balance the hops. The hops come through midway with resiny notes that keep the richness of the malt at bay. This is correct for an IPA; hops should be strong and clear per the style. End taste is extraordinarily clean with no residual bitterness. Feel is definitely firm and smooth, but not chewy. As expected, there is limited carbonation activity in the mouth. Completely World Class. One of the top beers that I have ever enjoyed, in one of my favorite styles.\n",

I do like this one better than my previous trip when I brought it home (DC area) and consumed weeks later.  Much fresher.  Surprisingly crisp, with lemon front notes, slightly dank aroma.  Good carbonation (fresh), though I had this on draft on a trip up to LA, this bottle version is actually better.  Solid beer, not sure it is worth the markup though (paid $6.99).

Gold-yellow pour with thin white fuzzy head. Aroma is pine-citrus with some faint mango and biscuit, not as pronounced as expected. Taste is big bitter west coast IPA - pine and citrus mainly, grapefruit zest, light malt backbone of biscuit and bread. Fine fizzy carbonation makes for a smooth palate. Bitter bite at the end that lasts. Very very well executed double IPA but hype is such that it’s hard to live up to it. Would get again though.\n",

Smells of light orange, mango, banana, lemony fruity esters, medium booze and a bit astringent, pine. Taste is resin bitterness, big and stony, sweetish pale malt and grain, a little leafy and pepper spice in the finish. Body is smooth, round, slick but with a buttery soft carbonation. Very well executed classic West Coast style, lots of resin hop but refined and balanced by fruit/zest, malt, and a really smooth body.

Ganska typisk arom och smak för klassisk västkust-IPA med granskott, kåda, citrus och apelsinmarmelad. Fina, väl integrerade och nästan subtila smaker. Inte så in-your-face som förväntat.

Pretty fruity hops, but some sweaty stankiness too, and a promise of bitterness. Once the chill’s off, some caramel appears too. Light palate, crisp carbonaton, but not lacking fullness. Oooooh, that’s a very pleasing taste - very citrussy/lemony hop forward, would not be surprised to see citra several times in the hop schedule - but with a very pleasant balance and drinkability to it. Like the bitter bite, makes my teeth slighty metallic. Light malts gently support the hops, but play second fiddle. Strange for a hop-forward beer to be better in the taste than the aroma, but I’m very happy it’s so. Finish gets more bitter, more herbal, and even with a bit of seared pork fat in it, which I particularly like. Really picked up after the aroma.\n",

            "(On tap @ Toronado SD, April 3/17) Pours a clear medium gold with an average white head and lace. Aroma is longer on resinous herbal and conifer notes than many modern IPAs, like pine and fir, grapefruit and citrus oils, lemongrass, some sweet orange and light tropical fruit notes, a hint of pretty clean and lightly sweet malt poking through the resin. Flavour again showcases lots of pretty hefty but flavourful hop resins, more pine needles, herbs, grapefruit peels, sweet orange, grass, lightly sweet and clean but definitely present pale malt backbone. Fairly high resinous bitterness, not totally palate scouring but quite a grip in the finish. Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly slick. A really nice balance for a bitter resinous style of DIPA. It’s not a million times better than other good examples, but it is definitely very good.\n",

As a stout lover, I appreciate this IPA not just for what it brings to my mouth, but what it doesn’t bring too. It’s hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so, and a bit more malt flavor than most Imperials. Keep Pliny cold, and drink it fresh. From a bottle, consumed within 24 hours of purchase. All around excellent, masterfully crafted (and marketed too) IPA.\n",

Цвет чернущий, пены почти нету, немного тонкой кофейной пленки. Вкус конечно отличный. Сладость очень выверена и круто коррелирует вместе с солодом. По началу снова много солода и сладости, немного изюма, намеки на сливу, но вообще шоколадные нотки, причем не только горькие, снова десертные позывы.

Taste is very bitter roasted black malt, dark coffee, peanut brittle and light toffee, medium sweetness, cranberry and some sticky tart fruit, spice. Finish is bitter, dark, a bit sharp and faintly smoky. Palate is just beautiful - creamy, slick, slightly sticky, finishes with some fluffy carbonation, dark and a bit smoky. Lives up to the hype! Aroma is complex and the body is smooth and incredible. Taste is a little more sharp and sweet. Rich fruit flavours balanced very nicely against bold dark bitterness and sweet nutty smoothness.\n",

Aroma is rich roasted coffee, dark dried fruit, leather, sharp alcohol - big Russian imperial stout. Taste is similarly huge. Sharp bitterness, earthy chocolate and coffee, sweet and tart dried fruit, leather. Lots. Delicious. Palate is rich silky smooth but not heavy. Finish very bitter and alcoholic bite. Excellent example of this style. Sort of a traditional American-style take, and very big in every way.\n",
            "9/18 bottle, about 13C. Black with a tan head that gradually fades to a fat coat. Aroma of mocha, fudge, stewed blackberries, plums, some overt alcohol. Silky, enveloping. Very sweet with quite firm roasted notes and strong bitterness that lifts everything away. Thought I'd try this fresh first and that the bitterness might be too much but it works just fine for me. Huge chocolaty malt is tamed really by astringent coffee, then roast and finally bitterness. The fruity notes don't get a lot of room but are there. I don't mind the whiff of booze. Yes, great.\n",

The body is definitely black. Very little head, a medium tan what there is of it. Inviting scent, chocolate, sour dough bread, malt. Now the taste, my goodness, it is like TEN FIDY on steroids. Very dense dark chocolate, burnt oak, ash, wheat toast, roasted pecans, just a touch of caramel. It gives a slight burn along with a strong bitterness. Now all I have to do is find a Black Note.\n",

Palate is medium bodied, creamy, smooth, velvety texture, pleasant alcohol warmth with soft carbonation and fruity, alcohol, then lightly bitter finish. Overall, it will be interesting to see how this ages. Currently the appearance and palate are great but the aroma and taste are a bit muted, alcohol is a bit harsh and overrides anything that might be subtle. Stay tuned.\n",

It is 10.5% ABV but the booze is almost non-existent in the aroma with a bold dark, roasted malt presence. There is some alcohol but it is not overpowering. Milk or vanilla too. Slightly burnt but more roasted. The body is about full and very smooth. I can pick up a bit more of the alcohol in the taste than the aroma suggests but otherwise it is mildly sweet, roasty, charcoal-like, with a semi-dry finish. This is an outstanding beer.\n",

            "I don't know if this was an older bottle (was sitting in the singles section outside of the fridge), but the aroma was on the \"soy sauce\" side. Because of the strength of this beer, it had that dominant alcohol smell. Thick, black appearance with zero head. Such a dense beer with very little carbonation. Standard with most imperial stouts over 10%. This was actually 10.5% instead of 11.5% shown here. Had a good chocolate, coffee flavor....but I still think I prefer Stoudts Fat Dog over this. May give it another try in the future, but have so many out there to sample first. Still, a very good/quality IPS, just not one of my favorites. UPDATED ON 6/27- This bottle seemed fresher, with a deeper flavor. Rating it about the same though. Aroma not quite an 8, but not low 7 like before (which had some more \"soy sauce\" the smell cause not as fresh perhaps).

            "December 13th, 2014 - Bell’s Expedition Stout feels like part of a panther at this point. Classic, well known, and an established reputation, it’s small wonder I don’t have the Expedition Stout with more frequency, save for the previous barrier of being in a part of the country where Bell’s didn’t distribute. The Expedition Stout advertises its unctuous intensity from the pour, slow and oily, like pouring a thick dark nectar into the glass. And there it sits like an anchor, unperturbed, with just a thin, soy-sauce like foam on top, barely a quarter of a centimeter. This allows the heavy aroma to unfurl from the brew, like the Old Rasputin but darker. Notes of charcoal, pine can and steak fond, with a licorice lacquer. The flavor is even more engaging, with a forward boozy quality that is strong by restrained. The heavy flavor oozes with a long, delicious caramel flavor and licorice aftertaste, direct and exquisitely balanced. Not especially complex, the flavors are direct and candid, but also harmonious.\n",

Roasty bitterness, quite high and agressive but it should be such in RIS. There is bitter chocolate and intense cacao in taste with nice, sweet liquor finish. Beer is full body, warms a bit inside and in the throat but anyway alcohol is well hidden. Even though beer is roasty, it’s also very smooth. Generally it’s very good RIS, chocalate and roasty.\n",

It reminds me of Founders Imperial Stout but the level of complexity is not quite up there - it feels like this one has less layers and the hopping is more robust. Also, the alcohol presence is a touch more visible (although they are both 10,5 %). It only lacks the \"wow\" factor of it’s fellow Michigander.

In the taste, I get Merlot, a warm fruit brandy, mild hints of chocolate, and yet somewhat astingent notes of coffee.  You really can mix this with a macro and create a more \"normal\" stout, as someone else suggested.  I took Schlafly Pilsner (12 oz) and mixed with 6 oz of Bourbon County Stout.

            "Goose Island - Bourbon County Brand Stout (2021) 14,4%   Styl: Imparial Stout  Alkohol: 14,4% obj.  ??Our rich imperial stout is blended from a mix of bourbon barrels from distilleries such as Heaven Hill, Wild Turkey, and Buffalo Trace, each aged in freshly emptied bourbon barrels for 8-14 months.??  ??Untappd: 4.48??  Kolor: Czarny jak smola.  Piana: Bezowa, smukla piana zbudowana z malych oczek. Z trwaloscia troche na bakier. Pojedyncze kropeczki upiekszaja scianki szkla. Brak wiekszego lacingu.   Zapach: Aromat nie wgniata w fotel swoja intensywnoscia. Trzeba jednak przyznac, ze slicznie otwiera sie wraz z uplywem czasu. Mnogosc akcentów suszonych owoców, melasy, mlecznej czekolady, kakao, drewna debowego i ciasteczek czekoladowych cookie.   Smak: Delikatnie czekolady, mocniej kakaowy, melasa, karmel, spód od ciasta typu Murzynek, ciasteczka cookie, brownie. Niebotyczna beczka po bourbonie. Zajebioza! W tym roku to blend Buffalo Hills, Heaven Hills i Wild Turkey. Przewykurwista glebia. Susz sliwkowy, wisnie w czekoladzie, mokra debina, orzechy migdalowe, melasa, leciutka wanilia. Wow! Ile sie tutaj dzieje. Gladziutkie, sliskie i jedwabiste na podniebieniu. Procenty kompletnie wymazane.  Slodkie, ale nieprzegiete swoja slodycza. Doslownie musniecie nut palonych. Cialko nienaganne, puchate. Wysycenie dokladnie w punkt. Uwielbiam i zawsze bede fanem.   Wysycenie: Niskie do sredniego.  Podsumowanie:  W tym roku Goose Island wypuscil dwa wydania klasycznego BCBS (nie mówie tu o wariantach).  Pierwszy to szeroko dostepny BCBS o mocy alkoholu 14%. Oraz drugi „minimalnie” podrasowany, podkrecony do 14,4%. Tej wersji jest duzo duzo mniej. Widac to chocby po check-inach na UT. 15,5k 14% oraz nieco ponad 700 14,4%.   Jakby to powiedzial klasyk „za kazdym jebanym razem” to piwo stawia wysoko poprzeczke. Co raku troszeczke inne, co raku tak samo mistrzowsko zbalansowane. To wlasnie ten balans stanowi sekret tego trunku. Cudowna, zlozone, wielowarstwowa beczka po bourbonie. W tym roku to blend az trzech znanych i szanowanych destylarni: Wild Turkey, Heaven Hills i Buffalo Trace. Szereg nut ciemnych owoców, migdalów, debiny, karmelu, brownie, czekolady, sliwek i wanilii. Wypolerowane, lagodne alkoholowo, jedwabiste na podniebieniu. Kofam??\n",

Do tego akcenty pumpernikla i dymu. Wszystko wieńczy piękna i wyraźna beczka po bourbonie, mocno waniliowa i świeża. Mnie ten zapach pochłonął! W smaku też poprostu wow! Jest spora, likierowa słodycz, potężna dawka deserowej czekolady, budyniu czekoladowego, melasy, cukru muscovado, karmelu, toffi. Dużo czerwonych owoców w typie wiśni, czy dymionej śliwki. Świetnie uwydatniona beczka po bourbonie i wynikająca z niej moc wanilii. Na finiszu czuć świeże dębowe deski i lekką cierpkość. Jest gładko i kremowo w odbiorze, ale troszeczkę wychodzi alkohol, co nie dziwi przy tym woltażu. Goryczka średnia, dużo ciała. Nisko wysycone. Wypiłem już parę piw w swoim życiu, ale taki efekt wow mam już rzadko!\n",

I've never been a huge fan of Goose Island, and I think that's because of the water (water is 95% of what you brew). And I like the Bourbon Country Stout. But not that much. I think maybe because I'm not a huge fan of either nitrous or pastries, and the 2019 gives you plenty of both. The 2018 is far better than the 2019, unless you really like chocolate-flavored sugar stout. The 2019 has a gritty mouth and a sweeter scent. The 2018 is a bit smoother (and fresher) on the tongue, with more of a whiskey finish. And at these prices, I'll stick with Boulevard (try their BB Stout). Imbibe and enjoy.\n",

Short tan head dies quickly to a ring with an island in the middle. No lacing. Thick, chewy, substantial body initially on the tongue. Deep flavor of whiskey, roasty raisins, caramel, vanilla, and alcohol. Sweet and delicious. The finish is mild (low bitterness) with an alcohol burn.

            "I have had this beer several times over several years, although I have rated it only three times; this serves as a composite review. I've found it consistently amazing, as much as it pains me to say that since this is an InBev product (but this certainly isn't Budweiser!). In 2019 when I rated it, the ABV was 15.2%. In 2021 that was dialed back to 14%. The boozy warmth at the finish is indicative of that. This is a composite review of the 2019 and 2021 vintages. This 16-ounce bottle pours pitch black with some brown highlights, along with a trace of brown head and lacing. Aroma: prune juice, molasses, smoke. Flavor: fig and date bars, prune juice, well-toasted raisin brown bread, well-roasted campfire marshmallows, blackstrap molasses, vanilla beans, dark chocolate-covered toasted coconut, espresso beans, wooden char, bourbon. Mouthfeel: full-bodied, thick, almost a chewing beer, with an oily and slick finish. I started drinking Goose Island beers long before they bottled and long before they were in bed with InBev (about which I feel guilty even supporting, but this stout is just really good beer). I discovered Goose Island when they were a smallish brewpub in a pre-gentrified part of Chicago. All that has changed, yet they are still making some decent beer, and some of it is excellent. This Bourbon County Stout is evidence of that.\n",

Body is like motor oil. Extremely complex + well balanced, super long aftertaste, somehow barely any booze despite being 14.1% abv - wow, this lives up to the hype. The barrel is maybe the best thing about this one, apparently this is the first BA imp stout and this still might be the best example of barrel ageing I've seen in a beer - the bourbon barrel is extremely rich but never gets too cloying or overpowers the base beer. Apparently the base beer was purposefully made to compliment the bourbon barrel and it shows. A lot of recent imp stouts can feel to me like they've just been barrel aged because that's what everyone does with their imp stouts these days, everything about this one feels really deliberate though. Now I really want to try a version of this from before AB InBev bought Goose Island or one of the special editions, pretty sure I'll never see either of those though.\n",

            "Draft third of 2017 at Beer Hawk South Bank. A deep, dark beer in the glass with a little head and some lacing. The nose was malt, vanilla, whisky and alcohol. The taste was all of those, but with the volume turned up to 11! In fact, all those flavours were a bit overpowering when combined with the rich and juicy mouthfeel. All very nice, but I was glad when it was over...... At least it wasn't overly sweet, but it was lacking some subtlety.\n",

            "Got a second bottle of the 2017 edition of Bourbon County Stout locally after picking up the first on Black Friday last year. This makes drinking the beer a higher priority than before. Not inexpensive for a 16.9 oz serving, just saying. My serving glass will be my ABGB snifter, the favorite for stouts. Do not know whose bourbon barrels were used this year, curious about it but I couldn't tell the difference anyway. The lid comes off and I will attest that this brew is fragrant, Strong alcohol, not a criticism, caramel, hard candy, woody. After the pour, a coal black body topped by a here-and-gone medium-tan head. Now the big test, holy crap, what a fine taste. Stiffly chocolate initially, the caramel shows up again, burned toast, malt, a slow burn as it goes down.Truly a great combination of the stout completed by a shot of whiskey. Touches all the bases for me. Do not know when I will have the other bottle, maybe after the release next year.\n",

The taste is, as my \"garbage water\" stout skeptic better half stated, like some great whiskey was dropped in the worlds best stout ever; it has a warming alcohol feel that is well balanced with an almost fruity red wine like body and a typically strong choco coffee stout base. It lives up to the lofty rep for the most part and deserves to be savored (can't imagine chugging this and doing too well).

There's a little roast malt and coffee there too, but you have to squint. Full bodied [edit - but well short of syrupy], lowish carbonation. Sweet with a bitter finish. There's no naked alcohol although there's a big warming burst at the end that's skimpily attired. There's more of a stout presence than suggested by the aroma although the Bourbon is more than prominent. Bread, medium roasted fruit coffee, some dried fruit. Bitterness is discreet but freshens things up nicely. Great beer. I guess I like more stout than barrel than this and it surely doesn't need to be 14% ABV, but it does what it does beautifully.\n",

Aroma is excellent; maple, roast, chocolate, sweet caramel, and barrel. Taste is equally good, the maple and barrel are actually more melded in, so the chocolate is as big a flavor lead. Terrific for balance, and atypical for either maple or barrel to blend, instead of leading. Perhaps due to the cellaring?? Medium to full bodied, there is a bit of an alcohol presence, and the blend is superb. Finishes sweeter than bittersweet, with depth. The barrel does still control the end. Love this! Even at the 1.22 cent per ounce price point, should've gotten more. 17.7\n",

Intense notes of sweet and creamy milky coffee, maple, toffee,  caramel, praline, cacao, syrupy, butterscotch, vanilla,  bourbon, nicely strong on the booze, light bitter finish: very well balanced especially not too sweet on the maple, great depth of flavors and linger. Huge body, oily sticky mouthfeel, low-medium carbonation.\n",
            "Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy head. Smell is quite sweet and dominated by maple syrup, with hints of lightly roasted, caramel malt and chocolate, coffee and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose, being quite sweet and absolutely dominated by maple syrup and caramel, lightly roasted malt, with lighter notes of coffee, chocolate and lovely bourbon notes, as well as a certain earthy, woody oak presence. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and an almost cloying maple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. Thick mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation. While this is a really nice stout, it's still highly overrated in my personal opinion, due to a poor balance that heavily favors an intense maple sweetness that almost drowns out most of the other flavors. Its one saving grace are some lovely bourbon and oak notes that both complement the flavor profile while at the same time adding some much needed depth. I'm certainly not getting any \"salty bacon\" from this either. Certainly enjoyable, but far from world-class in my personal opinion.\n",

Strong, beguiling aroma of thick molten milk chocolate, vanilla beans, marzipan, coffee liqueur, kahlua, ruby port, hazelnut paste, cognac, toffee, nougat, maple syrup, treacle. Sweet, candied-sugary onset, dark candied dates and dried figs, soft carbonation, thick and creamy toffeeish, chocolatey malt body, very hazelnutty as well, leading to a long, heating, brandy-ish finish with a peppery hop touch as well as lingering coffee and maple syrup flavours adding further complexity to an already full-bodied, multi-layered beer. Rich, boozy, bittersweet finish, very satisfying. Every bit as good as I was expecting, but again and like many of these American imperial stouts and porters, perhaps just a tad too alcoholic in the finish for me personally.\n",

            "Draft pour multiple times. Pours a nearly pitch black in color and topped by a small, smooth tan colored head of foam that shows good retention while settling slowly to a thin film and leaving streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma is really nice and shows a wide range of depth with notes of rich maple syrup, roasted coffee, smoky, salty bacon, bourbon, oak laden vanilla, and a touch of booze. A lot going on with this one. The flavor follows suit with the rich maple syrup, roasted coffee beans, smoky, meaty bacon, and bourbon all blended together nicely. Some oaky vanilla lends further depth while the toasted caramel and chocolate malts tie everything together. Very rich, decadent, and sweet with some balancing roasty bitterness on the back end to keep this from being cloying. Full bodied, oily slick, and very smooth on the mouthfeel with soft carbonation that leads to a lengthy sweet maple and roasty finish. An excellent imperial Porter that shows a wide range and depth of flavors. Really delicious stuff but best enjoyed in smaller doses as it starts to get very sweet as it warms up. Great beer that I really enjoyed.\n",
            "Sample at Aficionado’s during the \"Big Bad Bottle Share\" on 02/10/2017. This beer pours a dark brown color with a thick tan head that recedes gradually to a film. Partial rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of roast malt, maple, coffee and smoked meat. Full-bodied with a smoked maple bacon character and notes of roasted malt and coffee in the background. The finish is sweet with a maple and malt aftertaste. Very good beer overall.\n",

Full body, not too thick, silky-smooth texture and, again, like most Funky Buddha beers, a perfect mouthfeel.\n",

Not quite cloying....but in the neighborhood near the bottom of the glass and a full pint would have been a chore, a small sample was enough. Thick sticky mouthfeel.\n",

Head is small to average sized, frothy turning wispy, light brown, with spotty lacing and good legs, and is almost fully diminishing. Color is very dark brown. Flavor starts heavily sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes moderately sweet and slightly bitter. Palate is full, slick and syrupy, with a soft carbonation and a moderately alcoholic and sticky finish. A superb Imperial Porter with lots of deep and rich aromas, well balanced flavors, and perfectly fitted for a cold winter’s evening.\n",

Nice big fudgey chocolate base with both milk and dark chocolatiness. Fairly strong coffee note but it doesn’t dominate. Mild oak, smoke and acidity. Big, sweet and full flavors in the taste. Rich, creamy body. Moderate lactose flavor. An absolutely wonderful dessert beer. Funky Buddha really nails their adjuncts.\n",
            "650 ml. bottled 10/25/2016 and indicating 13% abv, not 12 as currently listed. Big nose of sugar maple, dark chocolate and vanilla. Some mild notes of coffee and whiskey underneath. I’m thinking I only just conjured up a hint of bacon because I wanted it to be there. Look is opaque jet black with a lasting film of tan cream. Flavors of dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, whiskey and toasted barrel. Later sips develop varying touches of blackstrap molasses, char, roasted peanut and soy. Heavy body leans sweet, but never cloying. Well-cloaked 13% and a smooth low-medium carbonation makes this one dangerously drinkable. Mildly disappointed in not getting any smoke or bacon flavor, yet I’d be contented to sip this all evening (or morning).\n",

It gets a bit cloying with taste because of the sweetness and the loads of maple syrup flavor but it’s still interesting with tons of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, caramel along with some spiciness and a bit of alcohol heat. Medium body, but it feels thin for a 11%+ abv Imperial Porter. Medium carbonation. Sweet finish with maple syrup, vanilla and coffee. Like many FB beeers it’s extremely flavorful - borderline artificial because it’s so intense - but a bit thin on the mouthfeel. Another \"festival\" beer that will get plenty of great ratings with 1 or 2 oz pours but that I would never be able to drink by the glass.\n",
            "Bouteille 650ml, bottle share. Couleur noire opaque, mousse moka foncée. Arôme de sirop d’érable, café, malt torréfié, coffee crisp. Goût de sirop d’érable, chocolat, malt torréfié, café, sucré, boisé, alcool. Carbonatation moyenne, corps moyen.\n",

Longue finale un peu collante. Plutôt facile à boire pour ce qu’elle présente. J’aime cette bière car elle goûte la friandise chocolatée.\n",

Pretty typical Funky Buddha, smells quite artificial, super aromatic yet the palate always seems a bit thin. This one is pretty gold thin.\n",

            "Bottle obtained in a big trade with AntonFred, sent to me by his contact. Thnx guys !!! Been curious for this one. Pours black , stable and thick grey head. overpowering scent of coffee, sweetness, and maple syrup. Oh my gosh what a scent ! Taste is thick, heavy, bourbon ( mild notes) maple syrup ( damn I am pretty sure I loved EVERY black beer with maple syrup so far ) heavy dark malts, sweet, very mild bitter touch. Man oh man what a beer ! The only downside is it’s on the rather thin side, and shile the carbonation is perfect in quantity, I think its a bit to sharp, for this style of beer ( perhaps this would be less prominent is the body was a bit thicker) . Than again, even in the category I’m talking about, this is a very subtile ’negativity’ , and to bitch about something as little, in a great beer like this, well, is just pointless. Just drink it, enjoy it, and share it only with the ones you really love, cause you will regret not having drank the rest if you don’t :)\n",
            "Thanks to spycow for this top tick. Not a great looking beer as its a medium see through brown, not much head or card. The aroma comes off a touch too sweet as the maple syrup dominates. After the first sip its instantly apparent this beer is to thin to hold up completely well. Its also almost too roasty. Its a beer of extremes, too sweet, yet too roasty, and too thin. The finish provides a very nice touch of vanilla that saves it. I warm up to this as I go, and its very drinkable. However, its lacking and not deserved of the over hype.\n",
            "Keg at route CBC Clapham, 02/10/2015. Sticky viscous, caramel brown coloured pour with a thin tan head. Aroma is sticky toffee pudding, caramel, Warming, toasted coconut.

            "\n",
            "Creates its taste foundation by bringing maple syrup coated, fresh crushed coffee beans, toffee and roasty malts to the palate. This creates a great interplay between uprising milk chocolate, whipped cream, espresso and cinnamon coated wood bark. Once established, the flavors mainly evolve due to the genuine integrated Bourbon barrel, adding vanilla, coconut bark, mellowed by the syrup. Coffee bitterness maintains enough character to cut through, soothed by whipped cream, becoming even richer, when a subtle smokiness arises from the malts, effectivly blending into the barrel’s spiciness. Finishes with milk chocolate, softening the beers warmer Bourbon bite, featuring an enjoyable espresso bean bitterness during the aftertaste, remaining on the palate for a while.\n",

            "22 oz. bottle shared by some guy I’d never met at a tasting that sort of formed around me as I was sitting in the back of Ei8ht Ball’s tasting room. The bottle was wet when I got it, so I poured myself a pinch (Danish style), and as I passed it to the next guy it slipped out of my hand, tilted sideways, and didn’t spill. But it knocked over a guy’s almost-empty taster, with the beer going on to the table. The weird guy who shared it jumped out of his seat as if I’d dropped a week-old infant and made a huge scene as he used his hand to mop the maybe less than one ounce of this into his glass (a big snifter - he gave himself the lion’s share) while chastising me and while refusing to make eye contact as I stood there, alarmed and apologetic, grabbing a rag that I wound up not needing because of his antics. I sat down at the table and grumbled something like, \"Have some decency, man\" as he went back to his table and the guys around me just kind of mumbled- although I couldn’t tell if they thought I was the asshole or if he was. Regardless, I left after finishing this because I have a decreasing tolerance for grown-ass beer nerd men who can’t handle themselves in a social setting. And I’m going to get a fucking rate off of this because I deserve it. It pours a near-black opaque coffee brown with a moderate dark tan head that settles into a ring. It’s exactly what I thought it would be - big coffee, big maple, big charred oak, big caramel and vanilla, big toasted brown sugar, and enough of a smokiness to add that ’bacon’ aspect. Medium-full bodied, with a sweet, sticky mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Sorry for spilling a half ounce of your beer, dickhead. You should be more concerned with the gut hanging out of your sweater and developing a basic ability to communicate with humans.\n",
            "Thank you very much for this one, AJ! Pours a dark brown with a dark tan head. Maple syrup on the nose. Chewy mouthfeel. Maple syrup, dark chocolate, oak, and vanilla. Simply superb. I’ve never had anything better.\n",

Bold, dark and roasty. Taste is strong coffee and maple sweetness. Very little bourbon or barrel in there. I would not say that’s a complaint because the beer is so damn amazing for what it is. More bourbon barrel would take away from the amazing coffee and maple. So if you are looking for a great ba stout, this might be the wrong one to try, but if you want possibly the worlds best coffee stout this would be hard to beat.\n",

            "From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis’ house. Tommy brought this gem, and I will thank him incredulously. This poured from a 22 oz bottle the way a heavy stout would. It was used motor oil gulping out of the bottle. There was a dark tan finger of head that slowly dissipated to a small film. The aromas. Holy hell. There is an amazing maple dominance. There were hints of chocolate, light roast, and a barely-there coffee presence. No bacon or smoke on this one. The bourbon is a little present on the end, but that’s what you want. The flavor is great. Again, the maple is the heavy hitter covering up a nice coffee in there. Chocolate, vanilla notes, and light bourbon are afterthoughts. The maple is sweet and sticky and the coffee is the only other pickable flavor. The mouth feel is light. It’s soft carbonation makes it nice and creamy, but it is pretty light. The aftertaste is lingeringly maple heavy with a light coffee dragging out the finish. This thing is what I’d imagine Mornin’ Delight Light would be. Excellent.\n",

Lighter body, the richness not as prominent...but still rich. Good syrupy flavour development with a strong finishing blast of maple. Fun brew. Both beers are exceptionally intense, with no glaring weaknesses that would knock them down a peg. But it is interesting to see that one specific type of beer is basically a home run every time among the nerds.\n",

Like Wide Awake, it has a great coffee aroma blended with the smoked malts, but the barrel mellows both. Bourbon with just the slightest hint of earthiness and oak. Subtle barrel character. Barrel character is subtle in the taste, too. It’s definitely not overpowering with the bourbon. It’s there, but it blends with the coffee and mutes the acidity. It amplifies the earthy character of the coffee and amplifies the maple. The smoke acts as a counterpart to the sweetness and reminds me just a little bit of CBS. It’s phenomenal. Drinks really easily for an imperial stout. Heavy, but drinkable. Really wanted to get a second pour of it, but it was long gone.\n",

            "Caramel, chocolate and vanilla all boast a complex, rich maltiness with delightfully well-expressed bourbon right beside it. It’s a good mix of rich oak and spicy bourbon character that is almost perfectly balanced by the malt. Only a touch of heat, with no sharp booze or any heavy tannin/coconut/pineapple. It’s very clean and polished and you can’t deny the malt richness here. Fruitiness is minimal, with mostly some moderate raisin and fig character, but the dark fruit-like vinousness here is very minimal.\n",
            "Malty, as expected, in the mouth with a soft, chewy, comforting, malty texture that allows caramel, light milk chocolate, vanilla, nougat and raisin plenty of room to roam on the palate. Bourbon is classy and restrained, but excellently expressed nonetheless, showing spice and wood and no harsh ester/alcohol sharpness. Definitely rich and sumptuous and obviously tending towards the sweet side, but I can respect that and the beer is so well-executed and polished that, as usual with Hill Farmstead, I find myself giving a high rating to a style I generally hate.\n",

This thing is magnificent. The pour is a dark brown, hints of garnet poking through. There is a nice thick medium khaki head that falls quickly to a collar, leaving no trace. The aroma is great. There is a big sweet malt up front with a nice bourbon to keep it in check. A light vanilla and caramel meld together nicely. There is a good sweetness that almost reminds me of molasses. The booze pokes back through on the finish, stronger than initially. The flavors are wonderful. There is a dark fruitiness up front, a little booze, and then the vanilla and caramel malts come roaring back. It’s layered and delicious. The finish is a little boozy again, but the balance is just perfect. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a soft carbonation that really lets it hang around. The aftertaste is lightly chocolatey, mostly dark fruits and caramel with a lovely bourbon singe that wraps it all up nicely. I’m so glad I got to try this. Thanks Travis! Boss status.\n",

            "Pour is a dark chestnut brown with a tight light brown head. Nose had a lot of bourbon and wood first, the malts are rich, caramel, dry chocolate, touch of maple. Taste is rich, lots of bourbon and slightly charred wood, rich malts, caramel, maple, a bit more berry sweetness in the finish. Full bodied, chewy, assertive carbonation, just a hint oily. Flavor just a bit sweet. Still very rich and bright aromas and flavors, solid stuff!\n",

Full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel and lazy carbonation. The flavor is boozy and malty - ethanol, bourbon and caramel with an assortment of dark dried fruits. Warming, boozy finish. This is complex, but red-freaking-hot with alcohol. A long cellaring might really help this baby out. Five months wasn’t enough. Can’t say it’s not tasty now, though.

Very sweet, but stops short of being cloying, followed by a little bitterness. Full-bodied and smooth, not particularly heavy, and a long sugary finish.\n",

Taste is sweet, but never even close to cloying, rich sweet flavors, like eating a fine dessert. Palate is nice and full bodied but again not too heavy, just the right balance. Very nice, best barleywine I ever had.\n",

Rich malt, highly attenuated with dark chocolate, hints of cinnamon, minimal chili.  My only complaint, and it's ridiculous and a minor one, is that maybe it COULD be a bit more sticky/syrupy/thick?

            "Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark brown head. Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. This thankfully doesn't have that odd, floral chili note that normal Huna has, the chilies feeling a lot more sharp and spicy. A little less earthy and bitter as well, with more vanilla sweetness and a lot more booziness. slightly richer dark fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel is actually quite a bit worse though, not having quite that thick, almost viscous quality to it that normal Huna has. Still quite smooth though. I actually think that the heat from the chilies and the booze work together quite well to create quite an aggressive character works well with the bitterness and is balanced out nicely by a certain sweetness from the vanilla.\n",

The taste is intensely roasted and the taste is initially big on soy, ashy bitter roast and cinnamon with not much bourbon coming through. This needs 15+ minutes to unfold the sweeter notes. After a good amount of time, you actually do get some vanilla, light chocolate and sweet cinnamon working well together. Very different beer after 20 minutes and it did become enjoyable but it just took too long and even then the barrel didn’t come through much. I was really crossing my fingers but as with many other CCB beers of recent times, this was just overly roasted, soyish, charred and ashy.\n",
            "From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting with ebone1988 and Gus on December 10. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a nice darker black with a thin film of dark brown head that actually makes an audible fizz as it disappears. The aroma is full of alcohol. There is a light chocolate and a good bit of pepper that opens up with it, but the sharpness of the bourbon really dominates. There is a good oaky barrel backbone to it as well, which isn’t terrible. It does sweeten up on the back end. The flavor is much of the same. The chocolate and pepper really come through behind the bourbon and a strong oak presence. There is a hint of sweeter malt and a kiss of vanilla on the finish, but the alcohol drives this one from front to back. The mouth feel is medium to heavy bodied with a sharper carbonation and a lingeringly alcohol-dominated spicy chocolate finish. This one is a bit disappointing for what I was expecting and/or hoping for. Not bad, but lacking. 7 4 7 4 15\n",

Aroma of sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, hint of bourbon booziness, roasted malts, and slight dark fruity esters. Taste follows, just a hint of spice, not as much as I was expecting, but the barrel aging probably allowed it to fall out. Thick and dense on the mouth, sticks to the back of your tongue.

Healthy bourbon nose, but it may have been healthier while younger.  Dark roasted malts mixed with light vanilla, dark chocolate, milk chocolate.... boozy alcohol.  Flavor is.... I dunno... I just keep smelling it. Seriously, this nose is killer.  I don’t want it to end. Unfortunately it seems like the mouth and body have kinda fallen off a bit.. could be from the age of the bottle, but barrel presence isn’t so much there.  Definitely getting dark chocolate and rich roasted malts full of dark and light coffee, but not much chili of course.  Anyway, I kinda wish I would’ve opened this one a bit earlier.\n",

            "Sampled at the DC Ratebeer Gathering.  750ml bottle pours an oily, opaque black with some red, fading head.  Big spicy, chili aroma, raisins, ancho chili, cherries, dark mexican chocolate, black pepper, vanilla, coconut.  Flavor of brown sugar, molasses, raisins, chili peppers, tons of chocolate, dried cherries, malts, light coffee, cracked peppercorns.  Full bodied finish although extremely smooth.  I was very skeptical of this but it lived up to the hype.\n",
            "Huge thanks to GT2 for this one! Black as night pour; looks like motor oil. Dark brown head. The nose holds chipotle pepper, mocha, cayenne, and chocolate. The flavor brings absolutely monstrous chocolate truffle, fudge brownie, molasses, and more of that light capsaicin spice. Also a touch of bitter roast in there. Decadent, smooth mouthfeel. Awesome.\n",
            "750mL green wax 2011 release. Rating #3000 on this site. Pours an expected used motoroil jet black with Martian red bubbles ascending into quite the thick, black looking head. Decent retention. Looks hilarious but the same as almost all Zhukov interpretations. Tawny, cellary nose with cinnamon apple and baked apples. Pretty obvious acetaldehyde like the Virgin Oak Hunahpu. Taste is woody, very bitter, rich, earthy, acidic coffee, very muted peppers. Great oily mouthfeel- wildly thick. Rich and tart in the finish with a lot of bitterness to back. Pretty good.\n",
            "Bottle shared by GT2. I’ve never had regular Hunahpu’s, so why not start with barrel aged version? Pours a rich inky, oily black. Thin dark coffee colored head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, rich chocolate, bourbon, vanilla. The taste is chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon, coffee, wood and peppery notes. Full bodied. Lingering spiciness. Very nice.\n",
            "black motor oil out of the bottle, glop glop glop. Head is standard brick red/brown, large bubbles fading to a ring. Nose is heavy sugar, marshmallow, heavy cocoa. Flavor is soft, cocoa, light pepper, moderately chalky in the sweet, brownie finish.  This trend is past poor now, just boring really.\n",
            "Bottle.  Thanks to Matlzilla for sharing this one.  Boozy/bourbon nose.  Joan Jett black pour with a chocolate head.  Thick, chewy, robust, lots of mellow bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, and heat from the peppers.  Fan-freakin-tastic.......\n",
            "Thanks GT! Uber black pour with a dark brown head- darker than most beer in fact. Lots of spicy pepper notes, vanilla bourbon, peppery chocolate, cayenne, and cocoa nib. Super smooth and supple palate with silky carbonation, epic viscosity, and capsaicin spiciness.\n",
            "Bottle shared by GT2.  Pours opaque with a medium, fizzy dark brown head, medium retention with light lacing.  Aroma is roast, chocolate, and coffee malt, light spicy peppers, prunes, raisins, and dates, light bourbon and oak.  Flavor is moderate roast malt, spicy peppers, bourbon, vanilla, and oak, caramel and cookie malt, coffee notes, light alcohol, and a dry finish.  Full body, high warmth, medium carbonation.\n",
            "From the 2011 release.. Extremely chocolatey, robust and bourbony..nice subtle dissipating tartness with a tinge of vanilla. Rich, dark fruitiness reminiscent of date and plum resonate. The Chile peppers are all but gone from the profile but there is an ever so slight hint of their remnants. Very tasty stuff, overall very pleased to have tried this one fresh.\n",
            "Awefuckinsome! Pour dark syrup with thin still black head. Smell wow?! Alright sorry this just a bunch of words. Vanilla green peppers chocolate cream lactose. Taste is sweet Cayman dark sweet chocolate vanilla on the top part of the mouth some light Caribbean fruits coconut pineapple. awesome thank you soooo.... much ccb.\n",
            "Old note from the first Hunahpu release.  Mainly just have scores for all of the stout variations I tried (it was a long day of drinking).  I thought this one gets overshadowed by the bourbon quite a bit - which isn’t my thing to begin with.  Prefer the regular Hunahpu to this by some margin.\n",
            "Lucky enough to try this and the reg version at Capones with head brewer. What a beer. Soft as silk mouth feel. Aroma is chocolate, wood, bourbon. Nose is rich vanilla bourbon. Thanks for sharing Wayne. Another beastly brew from CC\n",
            "Had on tap at Hunahpus Release in Tampa. Hopefully they will have it again this year. Poured into a CC snifter. Motor oil dark with a creamy sticky head. The nose is all bourbon with a bit of vanilla. Deep rich base beer flavors of cocoa and dark malts, with plenty of hot bourbon character. The chili pepper doesn’t kick in here like the regular, as I think it was somewhat overwhelmed by the barrel treatment. Chewy mouthfeel that really warms up as you go. Sticky sweet with a lingering bitter chocolate aftertaste on the finish. Needs a bit more time in the barrel IMHO, but still nice.\n",

            "T: Very, very enjoyable. Not a perfect 5.0, as while the bourbon does go quite well with all of the flavors in the original version, I though it masked some of the finer touches in the original version. Maybe it was just the bourbon, or maybe the additional heat from the barrel-aging, but I didn’t find it quite as outstanding as the original.\n",

            "The regular Hunaphu’s is a great beer, strange and tasty. This version reminds me very much of the original but slightly subdued, not so hot and a little more ’well put together’. I like it better, but just a bit. And mostly because I feel as though it has a bit more drinkability than the original, but it does lose some of the original version’s boldness. Hard to call....I think I could drink more of this and therefore it gets a slight edge overall.\n",
            "Draft @ Brewery: Pitch black with a brown head. The nose is sharp with roast, ample licorice and astringency. The flavor is chewy and more balanced; huge body with dary chocolate and light vanilla/bourbon notes. Like a cafe cubano, the sweetness tries to comprehentd the strong coffee. The bourbon notes balance with their sublety, just the referee to the game, keep things in line. Great imperial stout, more roasty than I like, but damn tasty.\n",
            "This beer pours like motor oil. \n",
            "\"The darkest head I’ve ever seen.\" Says Rusty\n",
            "It’s thick. Sweet, tart, and huge. Some black pepper. Dark meaty peppers. Lots of everything else too. This thing is massive. Not for the weak of heart. I like this a lot. I also never want to drink it again. I find it overwhelming. Not often that I say this about a beer. This thing just kicks my ass.  Sip carefully.\n",
            "Pours a fading tan head with a deep brown body.  Aromas are heavily roasted and dark sugar.  Full body, roasted, rich.  Hot at times, chocolate, some pepper at times.  Dry, slightly bitter finish.  Full and rich.  Warm and fuzzy.\n",
            "on tap.  wow, i havn;t had an inperial stout quite like this one before.  Pours black with a tan head. Smells of chocolate, bits of chilies, cinnamon, and bourbon. What a treat to be able to try this!\n",
            "Tap @ the Brandy-barrel release on 5/22.  Pours dark black with a much larger head than the brandy barrel...nose is one of the best I’ve ever experienced, notes of spiced chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak and some earthy chile notes.  The body doesn’t seem to be as thick as the brandy but is still more prominent than most impy’s I’ve had...flavors were heavy on the chiles, the bourbon almost seems to accentuate the peppers but it doesn’t wear out its welcome by any means.  The chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon notes are also apparent.  Great brew.\n",
            "I was definitely let down by this after having the regular version.  The bourbon aspect seemed to take so much away from the complexity of flavor in the original.  The palate is full.  Aroma was a mix of booze, chocolate malt, and light spice.  The flavor was strong bourbon up front with the stout itself hiding behind.\n",
            "On tap.  Poured dark brown with a nice brown head.  Nose is oaky, boozey, peppery, and chocolatey.  Taste is similarly oaky, with some pepper, roasted malt, and vanilla.   Pitch black pour with a thick sticky brown head. The nose is very peppery and a little bit spicy as well.  Finish is warming and body is very thick.  Overall, a nice brew.\n",
            "From a growler.  2/20/10.  Mostly black, opaque pour with a thin layer of tight bubbled tan foam.  Bold bourbon in the nose - light vanilla, spicy oak, and some sharper alcoholic notes that play interestingly with the pepper characters.  Some green apple harshness present intially, but dissipated after warming.  I’m getting some of that same cherry gumdrop fruitiness from the regular Hunahpu’s that reminds me of sloe gin.  Full bodied, medium-light carbonation with a soft, silky texture.  Chocolate nougat malt flavors up front on the palate, accompanied by some mild vanilla and bourbon.  Some of the sloe gin flavors come through mid-palate, but less prominent than sans-bourbon, as they seem to be shrouded by the bourbon flavors.  The bourbon character seems to be biased more toward the spicy oak and warm alcohol flavor profile than my preferred heavy toast oak vanillin, but then perhaps that can be attributed to the combination of alcohol heat from the bourbon and the peppers.  Pleasantly warm finish, with chocolate nougat, bourbon, and mild spice lingering on the palate.  Big flavors, but overall I found this to be less refined than the non-BA version.\n",
            "A deep dark stout with a thin dark brown head. A super aroma of sweet chocolate, vanilla, alcohol, oaken barrel notes. In mouth, a classy imperial stout with loads of torrefied coffee, some bitter chocolate, wood, tons of taste and warming alcohol, all smooth and pleasant. On tap at Cigar City, May 22 2010.\n",
            "On draft at Cigar City for the Hunahpu release party. This one pours an oily and visocus, pitch black color that allows zero light to penetrate. The body is crowned by a thick, smooth dark brown head of foam that receds slowly and leaves patches of lace behind. The aroma is absolutely incredible that is as complex as any with layers of rich milk chocolate, bitter sweet dark chocolate, fudge, vanilla beans, and a nice roast component to balance things out. The chili peppers push their way through all the rich and creamy notes adding a nice spicyness to the fold, while oaky bourbon adds its signature notes of warmth and vanilla to round everything out. The flavor is just as rich and decadent as the nose foreshadows with gobs of rich dark and milk chocolates, smooth vanilla bean, roast, and toasted coocnut adding layer after layer of complexity. The chili peppers add a nice little tingly spice to the tongue and some heat on the back end. The additional amount of peppers from the base beer is definitely noticeable, which adds even more to the flavor profile. The oaky bourbon then adds its signature flavors along with more vanilla that seems to balance everything together perfectly. The bourbon is very smooth and overbearing, which is really nice. The mouthfeel is full and viscous and very smooth with subtle carbonation that helps this one to be incredibly drinkable even with the 11% abv. The finish is long with the cocoa and peppers shining through and a nice warming from the barrel. This is an amazing imperial stout. I didn’t think it could get better from the original, but I think this surpasses it. Cheers to Joey and Wayne for brewing such a world class beer\n",
            "Tap at Rattle N Hum.  Pitch black pour with a thick sticky brown head.  The nose is very peppery and a little bit spicy as well.  Sticky with an intense cocoa flavour.  Rich with a bit of bourbon vanillaish character.  The pepper in here seems more intense than it does in the regular Hunapuh’s.  Rich and chewy with a little bit of anise as it starts to warm up.  Long sticky sweet/bitter cocoa finish.  Lingering vanilla and a kiss of oaky tannins add quite a lot of complexity to the beer, but it’s quite a subtle treatment.  I like this more than the regular.\n",
            "At Hawthornes as part of Philly beer week. Sitting out front with my two booze hounds on a hot humid Philly day and this comes out. Pitch black with almost no head. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, licorice, toffee, roasted malt and God knows what else. The flavor is intense with coffee, chocolate. The booze hits midway down the throat. Fantastic despite the weather.\n",
            "On tap at Capone’s. Intriguing brew. Pours dark black with small head. Comes across as a little bit spicy. Flavors of vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon blended went well with bourbon barrel. A nice tasty brew.\n",
            "Had the pleasure of tasting this one the day of the release after I grabbed my ticket.\n",
            "Was poured into a nice CC snifter glass.\n",
            "Dark as can be with a slight very dark tan head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and some sort of spice. This bourbon version really hits you in the face with the bourbon smell! The first taste is a mouthfull of bourbon but then slowly goes back to normal versions flavor profile. The taste is the usual IS bittersweet chocolate and coffee but then proceed with a spice taste. Also has a nice hop profile to it.\n",
            "Medium heavy mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation.\n",

            "32oz mini growler. The bourbon aging seems to have simplified this one. Aroma of roasted marshmallow, dried pepper, vanilla, dark chocolate, wet wood. Maybe a touch of ashy smoke. Other than the peppers, pretty standard BA Impy aroma. Fusel alcohol comes out as the beer warms. Pours exactly as the regular Hunahpu... Oily, impenetrable black with a sustained, frothy rich, dark khaki head. Flavor seems a bit thinned out as compared to the non BA. The bourbon presence on the palate is way bigger than on the nose. Tons of wet wood tannin, lots of fusel alcohol. Charred malt. Intense pepper hotness. Boozy, artificial vanilla extract. Blech... Greasy, oily flabby body with a harsh tannic, hot and abrasive finish. A massive step down from the non BA version. Thanks Jonathan!\n",
            "Handbottle from Shawn. Huge thanks for inviting me over to try... Pours a deep thick jet black pour with a very thin dark tan head. Really nice legs like a port... Hugely bourbon nose overrunning almost a little char on the backend... Flavors are semi-sweet that curtails quickly with char.  Heat on the backend which may be attributed to the anchos. Bourbon plays a pretty prominent role. Medium to full bodies with light carbonation.  Pretty damn good but enjoyed the ten fidy more.\n",
            "The look is dark, brown to black in color, decently nice tan head that coats well. The smell is bourbon, malts, coffee, slight chocolate, slight sweetness, wood, and coconut. The taste is chocolate, malts, wood, alcohol, bourbon, coconut, and awesome.\n",

            "\n",
            "T: The spiciness is a bit more pronounced than I would have expected and it really has staying power. The bourbon flavor is somewhat minimal, but the oak and vanilla from the barrel is nice. The chocolate and roasted flavors help to keep everything together.\n",
            "\n",

            "Draft. Black pour with some brown head. Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla,  caramel, toffee, pepper, and hints of different spices. This beer smoothed out a bit with the barreling and is outstanding without it. Heard there were some problems with the recent batch...\n",

            "\n",
            "The aroma has all kinds of things going on, starting with a sweet vanilla and bourbon whiff initially.  It’s joined by the underlying bakers chocolate and heavily roasted malts.  The pepper is present, though I think it’s a tad less prevalent than in the non-BA version.\n",
            "\n",
            "The taste is one of the most complex I’ve ever encountered, just an explosion of different flavors.  This is a bourbon shock up front but mellowed with some wood and the vanilla sweetness.  The backbone is black malts and dark chocolate, with a roasted character throughout.  The finish is wonderful and interesting with the pepper really coming out and does battle with the bourbon for who will linger longer.\n",

            "The body is insanely creamy and full bodied but the light bubbly carbonation keeps it from sitting too heavily on the palate.\n",

The aroma is basically all wood, lots of oak, some bourbon characteristic, but not as much as I had hoped.  The flavor is awesome, though, with plenty of bourbon and wood mixed with awesome stout characteristics including chocolate and coffee and a wonderful spicy finish as well. Love this stuff!\n",

            "Handbottle, with a big thanks to gunhaver for the major hookup.  Pours pitch black with a finger and a half creamy cinnamon colored head; great oily legs and no lacing.  Aroma needs a little time to open up, but wow does it impress when it does.  The pepper and cinnamon spice come out first, along with spiced chocolate, vanilla, oak, black licorice, and a little bourbon and espresso.  Flavor is more of the same, with chili and pepper spice, cinnamon, spiced chocolate, black licorice, vanilla, espresso, oak and a hint of bourbon.  The pepper and spice linger wonderfully on the palate more than anything else I can recall, decadent and rich throughout.  Wow, this one really delivers a unique and impressive experience.  Believe the hype.  Thanks again Geiger!\n",

            "Growler at Woodshop 5.0 (2/20/10): Pours an oily opaque black with a thin ring of khaki-colored head.  Has a sweet, rich dark caramel malty nose with some smooth vanilla oaky bourbon and rum raisins.  Starts with good fullness and rich dark caramel sweetness with some peppery spice and black licorice complexity before a warming sweet rich dark chocolate finish.  Could use a little more body and sweetness to balance the warmth of the spice, but a nice beer regardless.\n",
            "I don’t think this treatment is as good as the original beer.  Its an excellent beer still, don’t get me wrong, but the bourbon barrel overpowers the subtleties that make the original so superior.  The alcohol REALLY comes through on this one, and the peppers are lost, and the chocolate is pushed to the back.\n",

            "Wow, ok, 4.5 average? Heh. I mean, this is not a bad beer by any means; in fact, it’s quite good. But 4.5 is outrageous. The barrel pretty much ruins this beer. Though the treatment is mellow, it covers up all the subtle completely that the cinnamon and peppers bring to the regular version. I guess I don’t know why I expected anything different.\n",
            "Quiroga, you’re the shit bro. Woodshop 5.0 (2010) in Anaheim with many fellow Ratebeerians. Sample poured from cquiroga’s growler that looked more like a moonshine bottle. Still, oily black color with clear brown edges, some light brown swirls. Nose is gnarly bourbon with a bit of diacetyl and peppery tones. Flavor character shows a much different side, packed with perfect amounts of vanilla, smoke and oak wood. Extremely smooth finish. Interesting discrepancies between nose and flavor. Thanks for sharing Chris!\n",
            "#1500 !!  On draft at R & H.  Pours a pitch black with a small brown head.  Aroma of bourbon, dark silky chocolate, malt and peppers.  Taste of bourbon, silky dark chocolate, baking cocoa, malt and hot spicy peppers.  Interesting stuff.\n",
            "Tap at Rattle n Hum: Opaque pour with a deep dark brown head. Big aroma- some bourbon presence but it’s soft and oaky rather than boozy and abrasive. Creamy chocolate, thick caramel and a touch of peat. Quite toasted in it’s oaky character. Creamy dense body. Soft vanilla from the oak with notes of fudge followed by tons of peppery notes on the back. The pepper presence is resiny and not too hot. Residual dry oak and roast resonate in the finish. An awesome barrel-aged stout.\n",
            "Clark’d this shit from Woodshop like a pro. Actually, not as bad as the high ratings lead me to believe. Yeah, lots of bourbon that cover up any trace of the peppers, cinnamon and chocolate nibs. Still though, nicely barreled and lacking the chalkiness that I get from most CCB stouts.\n",

Overwhelmingly complex, like a pizza with everything on it, when your favorite pizza is just pepperoni.\n",

Dark roasted malty and light herbal. Mild vanilla note. All swept in bourbon notes. Smooth and dark malty into a lingering and lasting finish.\n",
            "Draft, well i wondered a lot why put this beer in a bourbon barrel with the base beer with such dramatic complexity i figured it would ruin a lot of the good but strangely this seemed to work. Pours a black body with a yellow white head.  Peppers, bourbon, cinnamon, and vanilla notes.  Just mouth watering.  Chocolate peppers, with a mild malty sweetness some light roasted body hints of vanilla sweetness quickly dried up the mild heat of the peppers.  Its astounding what can i say. 4.6 per the notes \n",

The flavor starts with vanilla followed by big roasted malt and then a bourbon finish.  Roasty and very warming but no alcohol taste.  My only issue is I personally like a full sticky body on my IS and this ones dries out, which is more of a plus for many people.  I liked it so much I ordered it 3 times.\n",
            "Growler at Woodshop 5.0, courtesy of cquiroga. Thanks, Chris! Pours a dense, dark black color at the core; oily brown edges; thin, medium-brown head with patchy, fine-bubbled lacing. Gorgeous notes of cinnamon, roasted / charred malts, and softly bitter chocolate in the aroma; excellent, tempered nose. Medium-to-full body: loads of coffee, roasted and charred malts, and bitter chocolate; again, the cinnamon note is persistent and lovely, but the barrel character actually slightly muddle the overall character of the (phenomenal) original beer; lovely still, hugely drinkable and pleasant, with that characteristic peppery spiciness; awesome beer. Love the peppers and cinnamon; light barrel notes. Lasting finish of dark chocolate, roasted malts; great cinnamon spicing. My final new beer of Woodshop 5.0. Thanks so much, Chris.\n",
            "Damn, I fell lucky to have tried this.  Woodshop 5.0  Pours black with no head.  Nose is sweet with notes of bourbon.  Taste is sweet, rich with a nice chocolate vibe, and a lot wonderful bourbon notes.  Last beer I needed to get to all of the top 50 beers in the world.\n",

            "On tap at the Rattle n’ Hum Cigar City Event. Pours virtually black with a thin dark tan head. The aroma is intense of oak, vanilla, cacao, and cigar box. Where to begin with the flavor? Lots of spices coming from the chiles with some wood spice (cedar, pine) and sweet spice (cinnamon) as well. Also notes of toasted almonds, bourbon, and vanilla. Medium body with a spicy finish. There’s more wood spice than pepper spice, but it’s always complementing the dark flavors and doesn’t overpower. An amazingly complex beer without going overboard. I’m not normally a huge fan of what bourbon barrel aging does to stouts, but this was just too damn delicious.\n",
            "Draft at Rattle N Hum for the Cigar City event. Poured pitch black body sitting unerneath just the slightest touch of deep beige head. Aroma had lots of vanilla and bourbon upon warming. Chocolate, deep roasted malts, lots of pepper and spice round this one out. Medium bodied that the carbonation had dropped out of during the barrel aging and a finish with lots of heat from the ancho peppers. The flavor is a perfect blend of vanilla bourbon, chocolate malts, wood and peppers. The pepper flavor and heat really sets this one apart from all the other BB Impy Stouts out there and this is a definite must try if you ever get the chance.\n",
            "Cigar City Takes NYC event at Rattle ’N’ Hum. A great start.  Aroma of pepper and bourbon come through.  This is black with no head, understated carbonation.  Above average mouthfeel.  The peppers come through giving the whole RIS an interesting and complex taste.\n",

Spicy, rich chocolate, cinnamon, wood, vanilla, bourbon. Great aromas.  Light spiciness, tastes of chocolate pudding, rich and  woody bourbon, vanilla, nice spicy character. Finishes with some spicy wood, lingering cocoa, faint heat, lingering roast.  Definitely delicious.  Really like the chiles in here. Sort of like a good Mexican hot cocoa.\n",

            "Pours a badass black with almost a nonexistent caramel colored head.  The nose is unbelievable with bourbon, vanilla, and a beautiful hint of chili peppers and some other spices.  Flavor is complex with bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, wood, and spices.  There is very little alcohol present and the chili pepper heat builds as you drink but does not become overpowering.  Overall, one of the best beers I have ever had and I am only afraid that I did not do justice to the beer in this review.\n",
            "Well, here I am reviewing another top 10 beer on this site.  You don’t do that too often.  I’m sorry to say I’ll be bringing this beer’s average score down, because I’d pretty much have to give it a perfect rating not to.  Joey and Wayne at CCB really do fulfill beer geeks’ wildest dreams.  Met those guys at GABF ’09, and surprisingly, they seemed like normal guys and not all-powerful deities floating on clouds or anything like that.  Who knew?  Anyway, I had a small pour of this from a hand bottle that came from a growler, so having been well-traveled, it went through a lot before it got to me and arrived pretty much totally flat.  In addition, I only had a small pour from which to judge this beer.  So my suggestion to CCB is to arrange to send me a better representation of this beer, and hell, maybe I’ll find it worthy of my first perfect 5.0.  Definitely has that potential.  So...this beer pours black with not much head at all, just a bubble or two.  Aroma is absolutely incredible.  Rich chocolate, cherry, vanilla, cedar and other wood, bourbon, cinnamon, tobacco, and chili peppers.  Even with a small pour in less than ideal condition, it really jumps out at you.  Wow.  Flavor not quite as impressive but still amazing.  Roast and smoke, coffee, bitter cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, tobacco, vanilla, coconut, and nice chili heat.  Really a lot going on with this one.  Bourbon is very well-balanced and not at all overwhelming like it can be in some beers from such barrels.  Full and smooth on the palate with very low carbonation, not surprisingly.  Even though I gave it a very positive review, I don’t feel like this really got a fair shake, so stay tuned for a future update.\n",
            "Rating #900! Handbottle from a growler courtesy gunhaver. Pours a very dark brown but not black with a thin froth of bubbles that reassure me that there’s some carbonation left. Aroma is deep dark and milk chocolates with some roastiness and cinnamon. The chilies are noticeable and interesting, and the bourbon is mild. Flavor hits with the chilies up front causing an appreciable warmth. Then roasted coffee and dark chocolate follow, well-integrated with the coconut and bourbon flavors. Very well-balanced, unique, and interesting. Body is solid and smooth, easy to drink. Hopefully I’ll have the pleasure of drinking this super fresh someday.\n",
            "Wow.  If you have not tasted it, you will not understand.  Pours a badass brown-black with a minimal off-white head.  Nose is bourbon, vanilla, barrel, roast, chili pepper, cinnamon, spice, and the tears of a very young unicorn.  Flavor really has damn near everything that is good and righteous in the world:  bourbon, vanilla, chilis, cinnamon, roast, earth, complexity, slight booze (but you REALLY have to look for it), and a mild heat that increases as the beer warms.  This beer redefines full-bodied and is incredible.\n",
            "Amazing. Had this at the NoHo Bistro Beer/Dinner paring and completely blew my socks off. Pours a very nice obsidian black with a medium cappuccino colored head. The taste is out of this world, you get flavors of bourbon (not overpowering, but definitely present) bitter chocolate in the front, then hits you with cinnamon and chiles  in the back . Chilies tend to linger just a bit after the drink, but it is such a welcome taste after the sweetness of the chocolate and warmness of the bourbon. This is hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever had and by  far one of the most complex.\n",
            "Growler courtesy of Degarth. Pours a glass staining black with a small but lasting head that leaves good lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, coconut, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, tobacco, vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon. Taste is the same as aroma. Full oily mouthfeel with a moderate amount of bitterness and a nice amount of warming from the alcohol. Another amazing beer from Cigar City.\n",
            "Pours black with a tan head. Smells of chocolate, bits of chilies, cinnamon, and of course wonderful bourbon. The flavor is incredible chocolate, bourbon and oak, some vanilla with that great hit of chilies on the back end. Amazing, just amazing I need this on tap at my house like everyday :)\n",
            "Growler courtesy of Degarth at TPD’s Tampa Throwdown.  Amazing!  Poured a glass staining black with a thin dark brown head.  Nose is chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and cinnamon.  Full body with a velvety mouth feel and soft carbonation.  Flavor is ridiculous, Hunahpus but even better.  Extremely complex, the bourbon is definitely present but very mellow and balanced with the vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, and chilie flavors.  Very balanced for a BA beer.  Finishes smooth and spicy.  Truly a world class beer.  Thank you Joey and Wayne for bringing light to Tampa!    \n",

The first time I had this beer it was pulled early from the barrel and it was fantastic the bourbon flavors meshed so beautifully with the base flavors of Hunahpus.  When I had it at the fest it had sat in the barrel for the full amount of time they had intended, I found the bourbon over-powering.  I was assaulted by the bourbon profile and it did hide the more delicate vanilla and cinnamon flavors.\n",

There’s a good bit of ash and/or char-like \"dryness\" on the end to blunt some of this \"sweet\" fudge character and thankfully no sharp alcohol ever hits on the finish; probably a product of its year in the bottle. Nicely aromatic, as one would expect, and though I wouldn’t go nearly as far as to call this a \"British-style Imperial Stout\" as many apparently do, it does have a good helping of dark fruits that the newer American versions are sorely lacking. Liqueur-like vanilla, German chocolate cake and rich char linger long on the finish.\n",
            "Rich and quite sweet in the mouth, unsurprisingly. It’s \"thick\" though thankfully not syrupy or cloying. Still, there’s a ton of base malt here, mixing with the dark malt to provide quite a bit of fudge character. Good amount of dark fruit, adding prunes, raisins, plums, etc...that help add complexity and gentle acidity in concert with the moderate roast and char character. Carbonation is low but engaging while alcohol is held to just a bourbon-rum-vanilla-like character that is quite enjoyable. Strong ash and light vinousness do indeed dry out the finish somewhat, though the beer is still very much on the sweet side. As is usually the case with these \"iconic\" monster American Imperials, I’d prefer it be considerably more dry, but it’s still pretty well-done/not messy for its size.\n",

            "Tastes of molasses from the very beginning, gently wrapped up by earth and profound malts, resulting in a balanced toffee impression. Bourbon gets then introduced by pleasant, hot oak, together with even more smoothing chocolate, this time heading into a bitter chocolate direction, reminding of alcoholic truffels. The bitterness from the chocolate turns more pungent during the finish, still soft on the palate due to the beers rich cream profile. Spicy bourbon completes the rich finish, accompanied by a dry touch, leaving the palate with a long lasting warmth, working its way slowly down the stomach.\n",

            "The more the beer opens up, the more I like it, especially its finish is stellar, based on its smooth cream foundation, handling Bourbon, licorice and peaty, burned malts. Its slick licorice quality grows a bit too pungent though, amped up by the malts, resulting in a sweet sticky impression, which takes up a bit too much place on the palate.\n",

Swirling the glass leads to a little head about half a finger in height. Putting the glass at an angle reveals some fine, pearly, lace that slides down slowly. Aroma is surprisingly subdued, the initial impression being one of bourbon with an undercurrent of vanilla and syrup. Perhaps it will reveal more as it warms. Mouthfeel is oily, bordering on the creamy. Rather full-bodied and sweet without being cloying. I don’t detect much carbonation, but some must be there for the head to regenerate. Flavour is predominently sweet with aroma notes and the alcohol is lethally well-marked, like an assassin. This somehow reminds me of the Funky Buddha Maple Bacon Coffee Porter except the coffee is less pronounced here.\n",

Lots of milk chocolate upfront, creamy vanilla notes....coffee and some more coffee...what a harmony! These TG stouts have some signature sweetness that threads them all together. Maybe hints of maple syrup that permeate throughout? A medium-heavy mouthfeel that never becomes too much with the light carbonation...and just the right amount of sugars in this to cut the booze down. Finishes with a gentle warming bourbon touch....not as heavy as the nose suggested, but prominent. A fantastic imperial stout that puts TG in a class by itself.\n",

Perhaps the most dense, viscous pour I’ve ever seen in my life; almost chocolate syrup in quality, with a small bubbly head around the edge of the glass. The nose and flavor were quite simply intoxicating; soft dark chocolate bitterness and heavily roasted coffee gave way provided the background. Up front was enormous sweet chocolate ganache, mocha and sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, marzipan, nougat, and hints of marshmallow. While rich, the palate wasn’t overbearing, and this drank marvelously. An outstanding product, reminiscent of Bourbon County Coffee but better. Glorious stuff.\n",

Bourbon is predominant with some vanilla, chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is more complex than anything I have ever experienced. Sweetness at the beginning with some coffee and chocolate in the middle, followed by the bourbon booze. I also get this umami thing going no with some notes of soy sauce. My palate was not as refined when I tried it, so I didn’t enjoy it that much. That being said, I can definitely appreciate the beer for what it is.\n",

Not really anything but a ring of dark brown head. Beautiful aroma of vanilla, toasted coconut, caramel, chocolate, oak, bourbon, dark fruit, hint of roast but mostly sweet. Flavor is bourbon up front with toasted coconut and vanilla galore, a hint of chocolate, oak, more bourbon. Finishes with a blast of vanilla bourbon and wood that is just amazing. Thick bodied with low carbonation but not as sickly syrup thick as expected from the look of this thing. TG is just stupid good when it comes to making beer. Jeez.\n",

Even a hint of pepper there. Very sweet and decadent stuff. Taste is in your face vanilla and milk chocolate - absolutely vanilla beans, peppers, lactose, very milky and creamy, like a chocolate creme caramel. Roasty marshmallow comes to mind.

The balance here between the beer and whiskey barrel age treatment is one of the best I’ve ever had. The barrell adds a subtle and measured amount of complexity and flavor to an already solidly smooth and delicious beer. Big chocolate malt flavors and sweetness. The aging gives you a nice vanilla and oak aroma. Not getting much of the coffee. Bit of alcohol on the back end of the sip and as it warms but again, comes in perfectly to remind you you are drinking a big barrel aged beer.\n",

Appearance: Pours thick, viscous, dense, motor oil with tan head. Aroma: Alcohol is big on the nose, smells like whiskey; some leathery smokiness (bacon -- I smell bacon). Vanilla, brown sugar / molasses. Maple syrup. The more I stick my face in this the better and more complex it smells. Smells like it’s going to be a huge, boozy beer. Taste: super fucking sweet. Stout, rye. Coffee comes through only in the finish. Palate: Rich, thick, viscous texture. Silky, oily, full body. Overall: Sweet, rich and intense. Overall: diabetes in a glass is indeed an apt description. That sweetness started out a bit much for me, but grew on me over the course of the drink. It would be hard to drink a lot of this in one sitting -- all the more reason to share it with friends over (or instead of) dessert.\n",

            "Bottle shared by Bill, thanks bro, been wanting to try this one since I heard it was better than recent dark lord vintages which isn’t saying much, but still needed to sample it. Pours pitch, oily black with thin head and barely any lacing. Mouthfeel is very sticky and thick, Nose of bourbon, banana cream pie, dark chocolate, char, and wood. Flavor follows suit with lots of rye, coffee and bitter cocoa powder left over. Full body, warming. My only complaint is its a little too viscous, but it works for the beer and the style. Awesome.\n",
            "22 oz bottle, yellow wax 2013 version. Pours thick black with a creamy mocha head. Nose is sticky and sweet with a lot of dark fruits and various dessert like elements. Some chocolate brownie, I’m comparing it to BCBS and it’s not all that dissimilar. Mouth is quite sweet, thick. In addition to the dark chocolate, gooey elements there are cherries, red berries, other fruits. Hot bourbon barrel char on the finish. This will impress a lot of people and it is pretty good, but I would have liked a drier feel with more barrel complexity and less overt sugar bomb.\n",

            "22 oz. bottle, sent from mista (thanks a lot, Geoff), pours black with a small brown head. Aroma brings out dates, roasted malt, licorice, and treacle toffee. Flavour brings out loads of complex dark fruits - dates, figs -, treacle toffee, caramel syrupy, and molasses. Extremely viscous mouthfeel, with the dark fruits and syrupy dominating the flavour profile. Wow - this is complex. I don’t really get much coffee and whiskey barrels at all. Exceedingly rich and deep. Not the easiest to drink due to the viscous, syrupy nature of this. Still, wonderful stuff.\n",

Pours a ridiculously thick, motor oil like viscosity, void of any light, creating a frothy brown head from the depths of the glass. Swirling the glass unlocks monstrous brownie/fudge aromas, strong bourbon, deep and delicate roasted malts and some sweet dark fruits intertwined to even it out the robust qualities. Spotty lacing, but huge legs are revealed. Taste is very impressive with a silky and coating dark chocolate notes, woody, roasty, peppery, more bourbon with an aggressive bitterness to even out the marshmallow sweetness. Both bitterness and sweetness are woven flawlessly to keep each other in check. I honestly was a little turned off by the figgy aroma, but that is nowhere to be found in the taste. Finish is very lasting, with a nice alcohol warmth that is very inviting. This beer encompass everything I want in the style: bitterness, chocolate, and heat.\n",

The flavor found lightly-smoked dark chocolates, coffee, and maple at the core with tangy rye whiskey and oak accents.. a lot more oak and peppery whiskey over decadent malts on the long finish.  Heavy-bodied and syrupy on the palate.. buttery-smooth across the middle.. great balance.  This was most excellent!\n",

Thanks SaltyMalty!\\n\\nPours black with some tan surface foam, opaque. Smells awesome. I\\u2019m not getting a ton of coffee here, but the barrel offers up just what I love: nougat, mineral, vanilla, oak, cocoa. okay, give it some time and air - theres the coffee, and it is classic coffee with a touch of soil. I suspect then fresh it\\u2019s more aggressive, but I\\u2019m uncertain I would like that. Flavor is spectacular as well with sweet malts, mineral, vanilla, bourbon, marshmallows. Full, silky body with nice low carb and a semi dry finish. Very nice, very fucking nice.\",\n          \"Bottle @ Beer Temple with Abijn & MarcodL, thanks Arjan for sharing! Black color. No head.
